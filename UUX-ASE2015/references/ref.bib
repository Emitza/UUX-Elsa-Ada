abstract = {The goal of this book is to give an in-depth introduction to this fascinating problem and to present a comprehensive survey of all important research topics and the latest developments in the field. As evidence of that, this book covers more than 400 references from all major conferences and journals. Although the field deals with the natural language text, which is often considered the unstructured data, this book takes a structured approach in introducing the problem with the aim of bridging the unstructured and structured worlds and facilitating qualitative and quantitative analysis of opinions. This is crucial for practical applications. In this book, I first define the problem in order to provide an abstraction or structure to the problem. From the abstraction, we will naturally see its key sub-problems. The subsequent chapters discuss the existing techniques for solving these subproblems.},

We (a) find that 13\%-49\% of sentences in our online reviews pool contain usability or UX information; (b) chart the distribution of four sets of dimensions of usability and UX across reviews from two product categories; (c) extract a catalogue of important word stems for a number of dimensions. Our results suggest that a greater understanding of users' preoccupation with different dimensions of usability and UX may be inferred from the large volume of self-reported experiences online, and that research focused on identifying pertinent dimensions of usability and UX may benefit further from empirical studies of user-generated experience reports.},

Affect analysis is useful for measuring the presence of hate, violence, and the resulting propaganda dissemination across extremist groups. In this study we performed affect analysis of U.S. and Middle Eastern extremist group forum postings. We constructed an affect lexicon using a probabilistic disambiguation technique to measure the usage of violence and hate affects. These techniques facilitate in depth analysis of multilingual content. The proposed approach was evaluated by applying it across 16 U.S. supremacist and Middle Eastern extremist group forums. Analysis across regions reveals that the Middle Eastern test bed forums have considerably greater violence intensity than the U.S. groups. There is also a strong linear relationship between the usage of hate and violence across the Middle Eastern messages.},

What are the information processing mechanisms and structures that underlie the elicitation and intensification of emotions? Despite an abundance of psychological research on emotions, many fundamental questions like these have yet to be answered. The Cognitive Structure of Emotions addresses such questions by presenting a systematic and detailed account of the cognitive antecedents of emotions. The authors propose three aspects of the world to which people can react emotionally. People can react to events of concern to them, to the actions of those they consider responsible for such events, and to objects. It is argued that these three classes of reactions lead to three classes of emotions, each based on evaluations in terms of different kinds of knowledge representations. The authors characterize a wide range of emotions, offering concrete proposals about the factors that influence the intensity of each. In doing so, they forge a clear separation between emotions themselves and the language of emotion, and offer the first systematic, comprehensive, and computationally tractable account of the cognitions that underlie distinct types of human emotions.},

Traditionally, studies of affect have used stimuli characterized along either affective dimensions or discrete emotional categories, but much current research draws on both of these perspectives. As such, stimuli that have been thoroughly characterized according to both of these approaches are exceptionally useful. In an effort to provide researchers with such a characterization of stimuli, we have collected descriptive data on the ANEW to identify which discrete emotions are elicited by each word in the set. Our data, coupled with previous characterizations of the dimensional aspects of these words, will allow researchers to control for or manipulate stimulus properties in accordance with both dimensional and discrete emotional views, and provide an avenue for further integration of these two perspectives.

We cast sentiment lexicon learning as a phrase-level sentiment classification task. The challenges are developing effective feature representation of phrases and obtaining training data with minor manual annotations for building the sentiment classifier. Specifically, we develop a dedicated neural architecture and integrate the sentiment information of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) into its hybrid loss function for learning sentiment-specific phrase embedding (SSPE). The neural network is trained from massive tweets collected with positive and negative emoticons, without any manual annotation. Furthermore, we introduce the Urban Dictionary to expand a small number of sentiment seeds to obtain more training data for building the phrase-level sentiment classifier. We evaluate our sentiment lexicon (TS-Lex) by applying it in a supervised learning framework for Twitter sentiment classification. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that, TS-Lex yields better performance than previously introduced sentiment lexicons.},

abstract = {A simple yet effective multilabel learning method, called label powerset (LP), considers each distinct combination of labels that exist in the training set as a different class value of a single-label classification task. The computational efficiency and predictive performance of LP is challenged by application domains with large number of labels and training examples. In these cases, the number of classes may become very large and at the same time many classes are associated with very few training examples. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small random subsets, called labelsets and employing LP to train a corresponding classifier. The labelsets can be either disjoint or overlapping depending on which of two strategies is used to construct them.

However, training examples in several application domains are often associated with a set of labels Y ⊆ L. Such data are called multi-label. Textual data, such as documents and web pages, are frequently annotated with more than a single label. For example, a news article concerning the reactions of the Christian church to the release of the Da Vinci Code film can be labeled as both religion and movies. The categorization of textual data is perhaps the dominant multi-label application.},

The hypothesized functional form-an asymmetric U-shape-cannot be rejected based on data from the United States and Sweden. In addition, the estimation results based on the two samples are similar, suggesting that the proposed relationship is generalizable. The findings also indicate that although dissatisfied customers do engage in greater word of mouth than satisfied ones, common suppositions concerning the size of this difference appear to be exaggerated.},

A multitude of methods for UX design and evaluation exist, but a clear overview of the current state of the available UX evaluation methods is missing. This is partly due to a lack of agreement on the essential characteristics of UX. In this paper, we present the results of our multi-year effort of collecting UX evaluation methods from academia and industry with different approaches such as literature review, workshops, Special Interest Groups sessions and an online survey. We have collected 96 methods and analyzed them, among other criteria, based on the product development phase and the studied period of experience. Our analysis reveals development needs for UX evaluation methods, such as early-stage methods, methods for social and collaborative UX evaluation, establishing practicability and scientific quality, and a deeper understanding of UX.},

@article{Hornbaek2006,
abstract = {How to measure usability is an important question in HCI research and user interface evaluation. We review current practice in measuring usability by categorizing and discussing usability measures from 180 studies published in core HCI journals and proceedings. The discussion distinguish several problems with the measures, including whether they actually measure usability, if they cover usability broadly, how they are reasoned about, and if they meet recommendations on how to measure usability. In many studies, the choice of and reasoning about usability measures fall short of a valid and reliable account of usability as quality-in-use of the user interface being studied. Based on the review, we discuss challenges for studies of usability and for research into how to measure usability. The challenges are to distinguish and empirically compare subjective and objective measures of usability; to focus on developing and employing measures of learning and retention; to study long-term use and usability; to extend measures of satisfaction beyond post-use questionnaires; to validate and standardize the host of subjective satisfaction questionnaires used; to study correlations between usability measures as a means for validation; and to use both micro and macro tasks and corresponding measures of usability. In conclusion, we argue that increased attention to the problems identified and challenges discussed may strengthen studies of usability and usability research. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As technology matured, interactive products became not only more useful and usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire.Driven by the impression that a narrowfocus on interactive products as tools does not capture the variety and emerging aspects of technology use, practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on ‘Empirical studies of the user experience’ attempts to give a provisional answer to the question ofwhat is meant by ‘the user experience’. It provides a cursory sketch ofUXand howwe thinkUXresearchwill look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a forecast of the future, but as a proposal – a stimulus for further UX research. 1.

Results show a shift in the products and use contexts that are studied, from work towards leisure, from controlled tasks towards open use situations, and from desktop computing towards consumer products and art. Context of use and anticipated use, often named key factors of UX, are rarely researched. Emotions, enjoyment and aesthetics are the most frequently assessed dimensions. The methodologies used are mostly qualitative, and known from traditional usability studies, though constructive methods with unclear validity are being developed and used. Many studies use self-developed questionnaires without providing items or statistical validations. We discuss underexplored research questions and potential improvements of UX research.},

abstract = {This article reviews five approximate statistical tests for determining whether one learning algorithm outperforms another on a particular learning task. These tests are compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of type I error in certain situations and should never be used: a test for difference of two proportions and a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train-test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5 x 2 cv, based on five iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validated t test is the most powerful. The 5 x 2 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, McNemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 x 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.},

abstract = {A huge number of informal messages are posted every day insocial network sites,blogs,anddiscussion forums. Emotions seem to be frequently important in these texts for expressing friendship, showing social support or as part of online arguments. Algorithms to identify senti- ment and sentiment strength are needed to help under- stand the role of emotion in this informal communication and also to identify inappropriate or anomalous affec- tive utterances, potentially associated with threatening behavior to the self or others. Nevertheless, existing sentiment detection algorithms tend to be commercially oriented, designed to identify opinions about products rather than user behaviors.This article partly fills this gap with a new algorithm, SentiStrength, to extract sentiment strength from informal English text, using new methods to exploit the de facto grammars and spelling styles of cyberspace. Applied to MySpace comments and with a lookup table of term sentiment strengths optimized by machine learning, SentiStrength is able to predict posi- tive emotion with 60.6\% accuracy and negative emotion with 72.8\% accuracy, both based upon strength scales of 15. The former, but not the latter, is better than baseline and a wide range of general machine learning approaches.},

abstract = {Users tend to use functional and usable products more frequently. It is also possible that a functional software is not usable or vice versa. Only functionality-focused designs fail to meet usability needs. Therefore, both usability and functionality, which in software design are interrelated, should be taken into account in the design processes. In addition, meeting users' requirements is one of predictors of project success. Therefore, there should be a match between the expectations of the users and the perception of the project managers with respect to usability and functionality. The aim of this study is to make a comparison of the project managers' and potential users' evaluations of the relative importance of usability and functionality factors in a software design project. Analytical Network Process (ANP) was used to analyze the relative importance of the factors.},

abstract = {In this chapter we provide an overview of the activities and artefacts of the user- centered design (UCD) methodology – a successful and practical approach to the design of software user interfaces. After tracing its foundational principles (early focus on users, empirical measurement using prototypes and iterative design) back to 1985s seminal paper by Gould and Lewis, we will highlight each of five central categories of design activities (Scope, Analyse, Design, Validate and Deliver) performed in UCD. Potential integration of UCD into two popular categorizations of software development (User Interface First vs. User Interface Later) will be explored and then demonstrated in a real life case study from the field of electronic engineering along with a practical takeaway regarding the relationship of UCD and eLearning. 1},

A more precise definition can be used to understand user requirements, formulate usability goals and decide on the best techniques for usability evaluations. An understanding of the five characteristics of usability – effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant, easy to learn – helps guide the user-centered design tasks to the goal of usable products.},

@inproceedings{Lizano2013,
abstract = {In this paper we present the results of a study which aims to explore the perspective of novice software developers about usability evaluation. It is important for a software organization to understand how novice developers perceive the role and importance of usability evaluation. This will permit development of effective methods and training programs that could potentially increase the application of usability evaluation. The results suggest that the perspectives of novice software developers about usability are characterized by a clear understanding about what usability evaluation is and a clear awareness about obstacles and advantages. However, our study also reveals certain shortcomings in the "usability culture" of novice developers, especially about the users' role in usability evaluation. Despite this limited "usability culture", novice developers’ understanding of usability evaluation reflects a positive opinion about their participation in these activities. In addition, novice developers think that usability, in a general sense, is an important aspect of their work.},

In this paper, we discuss a Web structure mining algorithm which allows the automatic extraction of navigational structures in a Web site without performing hypertext analysis. We perform several usability experiments to correlate the usability of Web sites and the structural design of the Web site. Experimental results show that the structure mining algorithm gives reasonable prediction about several design issues in Web structure. The analysis serves as building block in the complex issue of web usability and structure mining.},
