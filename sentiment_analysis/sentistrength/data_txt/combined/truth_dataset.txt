0	(iPad, iPhone 5, iOS 7) 2) When scrolling, if you're not careful, whatever file you're touching while scrolling tends to open accidentally.

1	Additionally, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date.
0	After a few easy levels, I am again practicing my aim.
-1	After I did the update it will not open.
-1	After the last update, it crashes every time I open the manual upload.
-1	After the latest upgrades, there were issues and now it crashes and I cannot access anything.

-1	After you beat level 22-2 it freezes and doesn't give you the points for the level
1	Again, working like the desktop version would be better here.
-1	Agree with recent reviewers - this update completely ruined this excellent app for the iPhone on IOS7
-1	Agree with recent reviewers - this update completely ruined this excellent app for the iPhone on IOS7.
-2	ALL 1,300 photos were deleted.
2	all in one spot From hair styles, to do-it-yourself ideas, fashion ideas to quotes...
2	All info available is just what is needed!
-1	All it needs is multiple accounts!
2	All my files and especially my photos are being synced FAST to my laptop.
1	All of my reminders, notes and receipts in one place.
-1	All other worlds crash except the first one
0	All pictures are locked and frozen.
0	All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want.
-1	All the notebooks are there but they are all empty.
1	All the tools you need to plan your vacation are right at your finger tips with this great app!
-1	All these updates, and I still can't rename things?
1	All you need for decorating pictures is in this app
-1	Allow users to force a sync!
2	Already addicted to the easy interface and concise, appropriate info.
-1	Also an improvement in the media player would also help.
-1	Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing.
-1	Also its more cumbersome to swipe through images since it's only responsive on the top half of the screen instead of the whole screen.
1	Also lets me post my crafty side and get more feedback.
1	Also like web integration.
-1	Also lost the ability to export into pages for editing.
1	Also makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer since I never seem to move them.
1	Also makes preparing a menu easier!
0	Also please stop auto loading of images in feed section.
-2	Also pops up for you to rate it at every log in so save yourself the annoyance and rate it right away.
-1	Also slows down a ton when I open another board besides my own.
-1	Also the Daily Rewards Power Up/Slot Machine no longer loads anymore.
-1	Also the play, re, fw controls you get after double clicking the home button no longer work with this app.
1	Also very good for finding a good hotel.
-1	Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders?
0	Also would be nice to rename files.
0	Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view.
0	Also, an ability to highlight/edit PDF's would be rad.
0	Also, can you please add the option to copy and move files?
-1	Also, I haven't found an undo option on the app version so when I accidentally delete content, I have to do it over.
1	Also, I love the new interface.
0	Also, I think it would be really fun if you incorporate a doodling function in Evernote.
1	Also, I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline.
-1	also, it'll be cool to add videos!
-2	Also, navigating thru app is now cumbersome and not as simple and elegant as before.
-2	Also, still not able to rename files -- unbelievable!!
-1	Also, the button for it is right under the pause button, which made me use it even more, I am now out of uses simply because they put it in a lousy location.
-1	Also, the delete function is confusing and should have some sort of dialog box informing you that you are about to delete a photo on your ipad, not just in dropbox interface, and ask you to confirm that you want to do this.
-1	Also, there is no logic behind the new tag section.
-1	Also, using the same view in landscape mode is really ugly and wastes screen real estate.
0	Also, when reviewing I can rate different categories on the iPhone instead of just an overall rating on the iPad.
1	Although it does take quite a while to load it seems.
-1	Although this is just a personal opinion, I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing.
1	Always find fun things to do and good food.
1	Always full of things that are interesting to me without chasing me or interrupting my enjoyment with endless advertising.

2	Amazing I love that I can even upload my own personal photos and have them as a pin!
2	Amazing ;-) Amazing app ... the best way to stay in touch with ur frnd.. sharw images ... videos .
1	Amazing app it is very healfull and very freindly to use
-2	An average app It's good.. but when it comes to "updating", it's pathetic!!
0	An Evernote system of tags and saved searches would enable us to keep all photos/video in one place and still sort them when needed.
1	An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel.
1	An extra I really like are the street maps and metro guides.
1	And for collaborating with others by using shared files and folders.
1	And great that it has desktop integration for a computer.
2	And help me with ideas for parties and all kinds of gathering and celebrations.
1	And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities.
-1	And I have to load it because its the ONLY way I can use it on my phones browser which isn't the mobile site anymore.
0	And just a user friendlier way to change settings and customize/add pictures to your boards.
-1	And now it says trouble reaching evernote server.
-1	And now we also can't see our notes on the map filtered by tag.
-2	And now, it takes 15 minutes to login when I open the app.
0	And photos of where you are considering to stay.
0	And please, add the ability to tag photos and video.
0	And subcategories.
-1	And that would NOT be version 5.2.1.
-1	And the new power of the red bird, directional targeting, kinda goes against the appeal of the original game -- you fire a bird and can't change it's direction.
2	And the voice recognition is great!
-1	And then I couldn't open all my notes.
-1	And then I logged into my account through the website and no notes are there either...
1	And they even have an app that loads to your phone and no data is required (as long as you load the city before you use it)
-1	And when you email or cut&paste into something else - it is a nightmare.
1	And you can even try to find the hidden items too.
1	Another update!
-1	Any way the other one was better and you took away everyone's favorite levels!also same thing as #5
-1	Anyhow, I miss Catch and some others.
-1	Anyone can c my profile pic Its dangerous.
-1	App crash Keeps crashing when you click on to the attach option
-1	App should be much much better, can't go 1/2 of what you can online, can't post pictures,can't see my profile or past reviews, can't even give detailed ratings, needs to be much improved
-1	app used to work wonderful except recent update.. unable to open most of our PDF files .. DROPBOX help!!!
1	April I really luv diz app...great effects on ur pic....
-1	As a result, failures are frustrating because the controls fight my attempts at precision, and successes are unsatisfying because it feels like I just caught a lucky break.
0	As a result, synching between devices is not always reliable right now - just a watch-out.
0	As soon as I get to the level selection the app crashes.
-1	As soon as i updated to version 2.1.
-1	As soon as this was updated it will no longer give me accurate search results!
-2	Asking for unnecessary permissions Also I do not want the app to run at startup!
-1	At first when I got this it was cool, but then when I changed my mined about having my camera uploads in my Dropbox it says that I don't have any photos in my library when I clearly have photos in my library....please fix!!
-1	At the moment, you can't copy/paste text, many users (myself included) have reported a typing bug where the cursor jumps when you try to type, rendering the note taking part useless.
1	At times even faster than ordinary sms.
-2	At times frustrating to try to navigate to check rates.
-1	Avoided updating the latest version becos during the last update, all the info which were not synchronized and backed up were swiped off!!

-1	Buggy, slow and insecure.
-1	But after recent updates I have issues uploading things.
-1	But after the newest update that removed the white dotted path that shows where your bird is aimed at and the strength you are using on the sling shot, its very difficult to play and not that fun.
0	But for me, the heart of the app is the near me now section.
-1	But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume  and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails.
-2	But I cant even access to my account because the app crashes in iphone size every time i open it.
-1	but i don't understand why we can't add a website even though it's an option.

-1	But the developers keep shoving the new shock bird in your face to keep buying whenever you're stuck.
-1	But the fact that I cannot add recent photos from my album!?!?!!?
-1	But the latest level just takes this game to a new level of low.
-1	But the performance is no smooth at all.
-1	But this new level is along the lines of Bad Piggies.

1	But wish it didn't steal all of your data.
-1	BUT WISH THERE WAS A PASSCODE TO OPEN THE APP!
-1	But with this new upgrade requiring iOS 7 (which I don't have), and many apps supporting other cloud storage providers, I find I may have to switch to Box, SugarSync, Mega, Mozy, or any of the other cloud storage sites who aren't forcing me to upgrade to iOS 7.

1	I am a self-taught old guy who's been messing with computers for about 12 years.
-2	Often several minutes of clicking on toolbars will not yield the desired function.Simple point-to-point route planning, finding intersections of streets, etc., take way too much effort.After a few hours reliving the frustrations I felt when trying out DeLorme's 2000 offering, I uninstalled Street Atlas 2009 and dusted off my Street Atlas 8.0 disk.
-1	Further, it is a fact that Rosetta Stone offers no more and no less drill for each of the version 2 foreign language editions.
2	The bottom line is Office 2007 is definitely an improvement over Office 2003, and you may hear some negative things about it while people are still trying to figure it out, but in the end it will be much better and more powerful than its predecessor.
2	Choosing to install the applets is simple and straightforward.
-2	Vista uses a lot of computer resources.
2	Looking for some enjoyable entertainment?

1	In most cases, CS3 does them much faster than CS2.
2	It's nice to be able to run Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and three other programs without expending all of my computer's resources, and this program is certainly streamlined enough to allow me to do that.
0	A fairly important note: most of this review has been addressed to people who have used Photoshop before.
0	For users that haven't, this is still the version of Photoshop I'd recommend.
2	In this day and age digital media is changing rapidly so it is amazing that this suite can keep up with many of the changes and still offer it on a disc.
1	CONCLUSION: I feel that this product being a VMWare product makes it worth what you pay for over it's competitors.
0	If you do not have a good computer it is your fault not Vista's fault.
-2	Windows XP does have its flaws though... namely in the method of error reporting.
2	The quality of the sounds is such that it would require no suspension of disblief to truly believe myself to be sitting before a massive percussion section, each player waiting breathlessly for me to command them - All I have to do is to close my eyes.
-2	Every programmer with a slight bent towards the musical is popping one out, and the vast majority are either overpriced, underpowered, or underproduced.
-2	SC is hard to learn.
-1	Unfortunately this time, the feeling will be accompanied by a sense that this is really not necessary.
1	I knew enough about camcorders to guess that I probably wouldn't get the kind that burns directly to DVD, but I didn't realize that our gift would end up requiring me to spend an hour on the phone with Costco tech support (thanks, Dan!
0	Yeah, well I forgot the fact that I didn't actually have a DVD burner on my PC, so I ended up burning the file from my laptop via a home wireless network.
-1	If you have read my review on Aperture you will know the areas that really bothered me and you will see that all have been addressed with only one must have item missing (kind of): 1.
2	If you want to, you can put it together in our office, so that if you have any questions, we can help you, their whiz kid said, who was obviously able to work faster than the speed of light in InDesign.
-2	The program doesnt load that quickly, and even though it could be my office computer, it seems to move more slowly than other programs on my office computer.
-2	I really cannot recommend it to anyone who needs a photo management tool.
2	The video editing has to be my favorite part of the collection.
0	The results were unbeatable, but putting it all together took one of those stubborn Im smarter than any stupid machine mentalities that entailed reconstructing the entire video from scratch to produce copies of the video for those who requested one.
-1	I said to her doesn't that take quite a while?
2	I would highly recommend this to any one it is cheap and quick
-2	Screen resolution was choppy at best.
-1	Before upgrading, you must ask yourself three questions: Can my Computer Handle It?
2	Hide and seek is always fun.
-2	"But it was an unpleasant surprise to have the game all of a sudden stop opening, which led to my ""stealth"" settings being obsolete when I had to explain the cause."
-1	Crayola First Ladies Costume Maker software is recommended for ages 6-12 according to the manufacturer, but I would estimate that ages 6-10 is a better age recommendation for this product due to the type of activities included in this program and the simplicity of those activities.
2	You can use wild colors, normal colors, stamp all over the outfits, and let your imagination run wild, but then again, isnt that the great thing about Crayola, is that they let your imagination run wild?
2	Well the Crayola First Ladies Costume Maker software program includes some beautiful stationary that you can print out and use to write letters of your very own.
2	As someone who has worked with children in various capacities over the years, I can appreciate the educational value mixed with the fun factor that Crayola is providing to children and families with the Crayola First Ladies Costume Maker software program.
2	Even if you dont home school your child(ren), you can still use this software.
0	Slowly you will grasp how the sentence structure works, conjugation will come somewhat naturally, and you will essentially learn Spanish without even realizing it.
2	After doing some research, I remembered Rosetta Stone, and how it was an excellent guide for me to learn some Mandarin Chinese.
1	Maybe Zone Alarm would be fine if I didn't update the program and only updated the database, but who wants to hang onto an old program when you know the upgrade contains more protection features and a more modern interface.. ?

1	I am now at a level of mastery where I can do a live performance from scratch and have people think what I was doing was planned out.
-1	Turned out to be a simple BIOs issue.
-1	If you are completely new to Windows, this may take some time.
-2	If you are a veteran game player, you will most likely find this review is only worthy of a somewhat helpful vote or worse.
-2	The other weapons, including the advanced weapons only to be acquired later in the game, were completely powerless and therefore made actually hitting a target nearly impossible.
-2	There is no box to check or uncheck so that this will disapear, unless you tell vista that you want to disable the security set up, in which case your Windows runs naked.
1	Example: Quicken for the PC has been able to handle brokerage accounts with checkwriting privileges for something like seven years now.
-2	However, once I downloaded the full version it didn't work too well.
-1	However, for most people this is more color than you will need in a word processor program.
0	However, if you are doing a fresh install this way (booting from the DVD), you the only choice you have is a Custom install.
-2	It took me about 30 minutes to just figure out how to get directions from A to B. Browsing the map is impossible.
1	Other Presets that I really like and use the most are, Random Trigger, Sakral, Square Pad, and Super Sync Lead.
2	I am not a photographer, just a novice but with Photoshop I can make even good pictures better.
2	The Jumpstart series is probably the best one that I have come across.

-1	My library is behind a firewall so unfortunately, I can't demo my tutorial, but here is another library demo that is very similar using CAMTASIA http://www.library.ubc.ca/scieng/videos/library_research.html The software package comes in a box with 1 CD.
2	There are tons of new vocabulary words and definitions to learn throughout the book.
0	This makes it much easier to manage organizing and trimming smaller clips of video.
1	I'm not quite convinced it teaches good counting skills, but again, I'm not worried about that, as I quit encouraging my son's math skills when he counted to twenty at age two and started adding 1+1, 2+2, soon after... (I figure if I encourage him, he'll eclipse me before Kindergarten.
2	Some other nice features are the ability to suspend a sale for later collection.
0	This is a review of the GuitarPort (a hardware device which acts as an interface between your guitar and computer) sold bundled with the excellent RiffTracker music recording software.
-2	The running doesn't even touch the painful experience which is climbing or descending ladders.
2	It may grow annoying to some, but I grinned most of the time.
0	in comparison.
1	There is a max sale price of $250 on the RMAH.Final ThoughtsThe game is good, but it's not great.
0	Player vs.
2	This is a big plus- its not always fun to watch someone play a game while you sit idly by.
2	It deserves to be given an award for best game in history!
-1	Maybe I am just not very good at this game, but to me at least this game seems harder than the older versions.
2	I really wasent expecting it to be better that Oblivion or Skyrim but in my opinion this was MUCH better!
0	There is also the choice to farm souls for hours on end and reach the highest Soul Level just as well as there is the option to defeat the game without leveling (remaining on Soul Level 1).

1	Not that any online shooter can be for beginners, and I dont consider myself a beginner by any means.

0	Bearing in mind you can only travel to new countries if you have completed challenges and unlocked them.
2	Recommended?I love snowboarding and I love snowboarding games so yes I would highly recommend Shaun White Snowboarding, especially as it is now available at such a great price.
0	I finished the first quest on the easiest difficulty, but I had to take the three clumsy AI characters with me (they were basically meat shields) as I got up close to the enemy and took them down.
-2	The biggest issue of all isnt technical, but the way the game ends.
1	But at least it has two modes so the fun can be doubled to a whopping 10 minutes.
2	Let the slow-motion rampaging begin...Before I say anything about the gameplay, let me emphasize how visually stunning MP3 truly is.
2	) Cutscenes blend in seamlessly with the gameplay which really gives it the feel of an immersive cinematic experience.
2	If you played the first two Max Payne games or love detailed combat and a lot of shooting, this is the game for you.

-2	All these scenes manage to do is throw off the games pacing and to be honest they are pretty boring.
1	You can compete with other country clubs for prestige on the online leaderboards.
2	Overall NBA2k12 is a fantastic game for those looking for an authentic NBA experience.
2	The dungeons/caves all look different and make you feel compelled to search every inch of them.There is so much to do in the game from blacksmithing, alchemy, sagecraft, lockpicking, and exploring that the game is one of the rare ones that I'd actually recommend spending full price on.
2	From the Beauty of the Citadel's updated look, to the Combat system, it has me hooked.In this series of games, you are always allowed to customise your character, your diolauge, your moral standards, your armor, your weapons, and your love interests.in this game you play as Commander Shepard (Either male or female, I play female), who, depending on your choices, is a sole survivor, a war hero, or relentless.
0	That is it.
-2	"One of the most annoying things about Peace Walker is killing the AI Mech; the repetitive ""la la la"" it says in a female voice is enough to drive you insane."
2	But for as many obstacles you have, there are plenty of good things you can pick up.
1	There are 5 different vehicles you can pick up as well.
0	The Death and Return of Superman was developed by Blizzard Entertainment and published by Sunsoft for the Super Nintendo (SNES) in 1994.

1	Available for PC as well.
-1	It's not the same SSX game that we've come to know over the years, but after waiting so many years, we might be more than willing to take what we can get.
2	I can see how it was a classic on the original Playstation for its originality and epic appeal.
0	You also have to, like in all other Zelda games, constantly be thinking because there are many puzzles in which the gamer has to overcome.
-2	The only problem I have with these cards is that some people can become too distracted with reading every card that passes through their hands that it makes a quick card game last forever.
1	Still, I picked it up basically for free awhile back and gave it a try.
-2	At first it's fine but later on you need to find seven at a time and with no indication to where this last keycard is the game begins to abuse your mind as you scrub the landscape for it, only to get lost for an hour.
2	The coolest feature for these weapons is being able to use them against the bosses.

-2	I most like when the toys attack you on following stages because it's fun to smack Mr. Potatohead in the face and see his face pieces go flying (The single entertaining kill in the game) The problem with the game is that every stage has to be played a certain way, so to finish it you have to master the technique for every stage which is usually very boring.
0	Of note, this series is in no way appropriate for kids - I don't even let them go into my bedroom when I'm playing it, between the gore, language and nudity.
-2	I hate them most of the time.
-2	Gameplay - 4: I have to mark the game down a tad here.
1	There were a couple of activities where I was trying to get him to do things, and he would drag a bit, but for the most part the EyePet remained pretty engaging.
-1	It's really, really not my cup of tea, but then I bought it for my kids, and all three played for varying lengths of time - though none of them 'completed' all of the objectives.
-1	Sometimes a name sounds a bit odd, like it's been shoehorned into the sentence - which obviously it has, but this is rare.
2	There's of course most of the standard modes like quickplay, a franchise/association, create a player, online quick matches, online leagues, minigames/drills and so on.
0	Following this release developer Ubi Soft announced a supposed return to form for the limbless Rayman subtitled 'Origins.
2	The layouts are well thought out and often make you think on your feet.
0	Whatever the story you come up with, think of one that gives your character a reason for being captured by the Imperial guards and hauled up to Helgen in Skyrim in that wagon at the beginning of the game.
-2	Unfortunately it doesn't work because every two seconds there's a random encounter.
1	Difficulty: I havent found this game to be overly difficult for the setting I chose, and feel this game can be played by about any type of gamer.
1	There's a Golden Bullets Mode where all of your bullets kill enemies in one shot at the cost of Rubi having much less endurance.
-1	Sadly, there is no real story in Metroid, outside of the awesome story given in the instruction booklet (and a short but cool one in the intro if you wait a bit), but story generally was not part of the gameplay in NES titles (the Ninja Gaiden games being an obvious exception) so that's to be expected.
0	After Ultima II took place on Earth, Ultima III returns to the land of Sosaria where the player's goal is to defeat the game's antagonist and namesake, Exodus.
0	The Morph Ball is one such ability and was one of the main concerns players had before Metroid Prime's release.
2	This is probably for the best because there's no feasible way to explain how the various Sega mascots have come together.
2	It's actually really nice not having to worry about being hit by a blue shell moments before crossing the finish line, and this is an absolutely huge advantage that Sonic and crew have over Mario.
-1	This is made less painful by the fact that you are allowed to retry should you lose, but at the same time, it seems completely unnecessary for the battle to end should the one character you have control over die.
2	The battle theme is amongst my favorites in the entire series - I think it fits the fast pace of the game very nicely with its high tempo and chaotic atmosphere.
2	The artists behind the game made excellent use of lighting and shadows, and they were way ahead of their time when compared to most every other game out back then.
1	I recommend simply going with a pre-loaded history.
-2	The first time I fired up Origins and saw I only had three classes, I was disappointed.

2	One of my favorites genres of video games is the dungeon crawler.
-1	Its not flawless, but the passage of time has been mostly kind to Master Chiefs Xbox debut.

0	I have not tried to move more than 2 into one house but it is on my list to try.
2	This is about as racy as the game gets.
1	Shipping was super fast, I received it in three days.
2	Thankfully the sequel was a huge improvement, and I would more than likely agree that game revolutionized the side scrolling brawler, as well as it being an all time Sega great.
-1	The rest of the game is made up of QTE (Quick Time Events), meaning that you have to follow the on-screen prompts to survive.
2	Still, overall Id rate the graphics as good.

1	The pacing isn't as tight as what you remember from Arkham Asylum, but the trade-off is worth it on the whole.
0	Even then, it seems a little phoned-in this time around.
-1	Presentation-wise the game is a mixed bag.
2	well Bethesda took that formula and fixed everything people complained about and made Skyrim.
1	The AI are pretty smart and will try to flank your position and if you dont watch your back youll more than likely get surrounded and overwhelmed resulting in death.
2	But it's fun.
1	The characters use the 3D in their polygonal look and the lively sprites have some depth to them.
1	That may seem familiar, but the environment of Arkham City is now five times larger than Asylum and so control of Batman has been improved to accommodate this.
-2	"Many people believe that this game ruined many of the theme, the key one being the ""cornered"" theme."
0	GraphicsGraphics are again the same as Haulin' and American Long Haul.
2	There are numerous occasions of epicness in the game.
-2	At times, I just found these to be too distracting from the main game, and the story as well as pacing was kind of hurt.
0	Kill Confirmed requires you to collect the dog tags of murdered players in order for the kills to count.
0	Some execute different patterns of shooting various bullets or other objects at you, some spawn other enemies to swarm you, and some just try to run you over.
2	Upbeat electronic synth tracks add to the excitement, but the sound effects were barely noticeable.
0	Entering this at the title screen allowed you to start off with 30 extra lives instead of 3.
0	Revive your friends with Medic, repair vehicles, or even snipe people across the map.
-1	Fortunately Battlefield 3 isn't about the single player it's about the online.
2	) I found that Madden 2005 was a bigger, updated retreat of Madden's trademark slippy, unrealistic arcade gameplay while ESPN 2K that year was (and still is) the finest football game ever made.
1	At last, 2K Sports has made a football game in which using a zone defense isn't just for people who like to give up first downs.
2	Gears of War 3 has a great storyline, despite it's shortness.
2	The story all ties in with its predacessors and made me feel like I was Fenix.

-1	Making the game more complicated are night levels.
2	The original Resident Evil 4 (RE4) for the Nintendo Gamecube (2005) was a revelation for the gaming industry.
0	The Wii-Mote system throws all that out the window.

2	What one gets out of Innocent Sin will depend on the person playing it.
1	Okay, in the case of Mustafar this is understandable because Mustafar is a world of volcanic heat and lava, where the bad guys were hiding in a small, closed facility to arouse as little suspicion as possible.
0	This is presented using the third person format and plays a lot like one of the Assassin's Creed games, though the controls aren't as tight.
2	The game was amazing for its time and was the scariest title to hit consoles (before Silent Hill).
1	Crimsons are faster, stronger, and they break through doors to get to you.
0	So, if I beat Iceman in Megaman 1, I would have liked to be able to use it on Heatman in Megaman 2.
-1	In the end, I did not find any reason to watch the videos nor strive to unlock them.
0	At this point, her consciousness and its are one.
0	Lost Odyssey plays like an old turn based RPG, you take your turns in rounds, once you select the moves the round begins and both the monsters and your side attacks.

-1	A Year Without Rain 2.
0	For example, in the beginning of the game, you have the simple slash attack.
1	It wouldn't be fair to compare it to, for instance, the latest FIFA or PES games because it's aiming to be a completely different gaming experience (plus, it's created by a single person instead of a huge team!).

-2	Worse yet, several of the towns locals are in the forest with him and they seem to have gone a little mad the once friendly small town folk are now trying to chop him to bits.From the start you begin finding pages from a novel that Alan has not yet written, but under the title that he had decided on long ago for his next novel Departure.
2	What makes this cool is the fact that most of whats on the tube is shot in live action, including interviews with Alan Wake himself who is played by a real life actor during these sequences.The soundtrack is another high point here.

1	This way you can catch piscine prizes to transform your dog or cat (or boar, fox or drone) into something useful.
1	You can customize the settings on your account that will filter out any profanity that is spoken in the chat.

-2	There is a multi-cart multiplayer, but you'll be spending gobs of money and most folks in the states will not find another person with the same cart given its rarity.

-2	This game demands a fair amount of technique and it doesnt take long to get noticeably better at it which makes surpassing your high score a very addictive carrot dangled in front of your face.
0	100,000 points are added if you clear the orange pegs on your first try, 50,000 on your second and 25,000 on your third.

2	I highly recommend it.
0	It has roughly 20 levels in the game which boils game time down to something like 3-4 hours.
2	Perhaps the game lacks a little atmosphere at times, but the intensity of the tennis matches themselves makes up for that and you definitely start to feel involved with what happens to your players.
-1	But again, shooting only encompasses less than half the game.
2	"The online is fun, the campaign is fun for a bit and the overall game play is great.Summary: When I hear the words ""Battlefield Bad Company 2"" I think of one of the best online games I have ever played."
-1	The original Super Mario Land is not one of my favorite games.
-1	Things start off normal enough with your trademark goombas and koopa troopas, but once you start delving deeper into the game you'll find some rather unorthodox enemies for a Mario title.
2	What I do like is the fact that the sound effects are significantly improved from the first Land game, and are now much more fitting a Mario title.
0	The game basically works by each unit having a field of vision / attack range and a field of movement.
2	All in all, this game has tremendous replay.
2	"You can also choose to purchase a more recent version such as ""Fast Food Tycoon 2"".There are quite a few cheat codes on line that you might want to check out to enhance the fun of the game.For versatility, involved play and replay value, I give this game a ""thumbs up"".Ski Resort Tycoon is also a business sim; and the objective is to create and run your own ski resort and end up with a 5-star rating."
0	These map packs can be purchased for 1200 Microsoft points each).
0	For example, one may have to choose between having a combined 6 extra spells to use (one square with three others that count for double the spell placed inside of it), or a weapon that is extra powered up and two spells to use.

-2	I was unable to get into campaign games and free play games often had high lag, random crashes, and other bugs.
0	Next is the engineer class.
1	Instead of letting you just slash the knife out like you can in Call of Duty: Black Ops, this game goes into different animations but it requires you to be really close and time it just right, so melee attacks disrupt the flow in a way.

2	I bought Crysis 2 because i heard it was a good game and there was quite a bit of excitement about it.

-1	I have heard a few people talk about how that could happen but I don't think it will.
-2	The first issue with Sheva is that she's a loot wh*re.
-1	Inventory space is limited to nine slots for entire game (Sheva has nine of her own as well) and it's nice that you don't have to play mini-Tetris by flipping things around to make them fit in this title, but the lack of slots is still a problem.
-2	However, the targeting system is atrocious, and it doesn't compare with the N64 version at all.
-1	If dealing with different zombies wasn't enough the environment you defend keeps throwing curveballs at you as well.
2	With over 10 worlds to explore, 120 stars to collect, you will never get bored of this Nintendo 64 classic.
0	Namely that will never happen.
-1	It is not a change for the better.

0	Like many roleplaying games, you start out with skill points that determine your ability to do things such as use pistols, or rifles, or hack computers, or use medical bandages.

2	I love it so much and play it all of the time.
2	I have played it for so much time and have had fun trying to defeat my enemies.
1	The matches will always be vastly different.
1	A story mode is also included to provide solo campaign when friends are not present.
-1	While the story and setting may not appeal to everybody, it is like Bethesda read my mind about what kind of game and setting I would want, with my strange obsession for post-apocalyptic movies and television.
1	Getting around maps seems easier in this aspect.
0	You character, a space pirate named Grayson Hunt, and Ishi Sato where members of a black op squad, named Dead Echo.
-2	The main gripe people seem to have are the numerous bugs in the console versions.
2	Of all the games we looked into, this looked very preschool-friendly as well as a good learning tool.

0	If you do, consider giving Ecco the Dolphin Defender of the Future a glance.
-2	This game is chock full of glitches, some of which can just be as simple as the rock face not completely touching the computer generated ground, or a shark fazing in and out of the wall structure, simple things like that.
1	For REAL gaming perfectionists though, there are collectible band-aids in each world, along with hidden areas called warp zones.
-1	That's a cool feature but the gameplay isn't fun or deep enough to warrant seeking these out.That said, this is a short game.
0	But they are motion sensitive.
2	And yes, you can tell the machine you are left handed, and it responds accordingly.
-2	I find this one fun if I'm playing it with a friend, but against the computer it gets boring quickly.
-2	The checkpoints are hard to come by and the graphics won't turn any heads (In fact it might be a port even) but the classic MoH gameplay and the really cool open mission structures are fun to parachute into and blow things up.
1	There are multpile sports to choose from and is suitable for all groups.
1	In addition to the spell creation system there is also the ability to break down almost every item into its original materials which can be used to upgrade other items.
0	*Doom Gems- These gems can begin to appear in level 13 of classic mode.
-1	My skepticism is more rooted in how there are so many games out there which are popular only because they catch a wave of popularity, not because they're especially clever or engaging.
-1	Other shorter activities include picking the correct animal out of a photo lineup or other quick activities.This game is cute, but it does get repetitive.
0	Some will choose a specific table and some will choose a specific person the do or do not want to sit by.
1	Watch as characters react to you shooting their hats off (or watch as they drop dead because you missed heh, I gave one bad bald bastard an inverted skin mohawk thanks to a strategically-placed bullet).
-1	This was both helpful and annoying.At times you would try to turn the camera and end up only being able to see the closest wall to you, and you would be on the other side of that wall, however, the game itself more than compensated for it.The new angle is a fixed position camera.
2	They're all delivered with half circle motions, basically, a Street Fighter fan will have no problem understanding how these moves work.
0	Violin shrills warn you when a Witch is near, a short burst of the Trombone section commences on cue when the robust hulk like creature (Tank) comes barreling your direction, throwing anything heavy at you on its path to destroy anything ( being you) in its way.
-1	The story is entertaining, the main character is interesting, and the minor characters fit well within what is happening.The one thing I did not expect was the racist over tones of the game.
2	The collectors edition is especially nice as it includes goodies, like a DVD featuring the making of the game and a short movie, a concept art book, a pen shaped like a Zombrex syringe, a Zombrex bandage, a poster and a card warning about how to avoid infection from zombies.
-2	First of all i would like to say without giving away any spoilers, that it was the worst ending of a game I have ever seen in my lifetime, and I've played a lot of games.
2	This weapon customization feature can be quite humorous as well, because you are given options like making all of your grenades gold and diamond-encrusted, or if you like the cheap look, you can add a screwdriver to your gun as a bayonet.
1	Your teammate are smart too, making correct cuts to the basket and filling in the lanes.
2	Play the single player mode all the way through, just play all the different mini-games once in a while, or get the family together and battle it out there is a lot to do.
2	There is a wider variety of trucks to choose from (my favorite being grave digger), and you can customize and upgrade your truck much more than other versions.
-1	Yes the sensory MIGHT be a little better as well as the graphics, but I would take longer workouts, better customization and motivation over that anyday!
2	Love it.
1	When you raise your hands, you will hear cheering, and that is when you are ready to start also.
0	Party game/mode -When you have guests in your house, this is the best option you should go to.
0	"I would really like to see a sequel that takes this idea and gives the player much tougher challenges; ""Extreme Puzzle Bots"", anyone?!"
1	It's not difficult to master this game (top tip: never stop drifting), so you're often blazing a trail way in front of the pack, and weapons pack less of a punch so feel less important.
2	There are a total of 32 tracks to race on, and there are tons of unlockables.
2	If you enjoy the fighting genre of games I have no doubt youll be glad you added this one to your collection.

1	There is definitely a lot of things for gun customizations, which make it really fun.

0	In the Honor roll section you can see your game progress.
0	You can peek at your helpers paper, or copy off your classmate.
2	Players from both teams may be asked to take turns while competing, or they may play at the same time.Graphics and SoundThe on-screen people are meant to be cartoonish, however, even though their movement is simple, it's pretty realistic.
0	Then you use the B button to throw your ax.

1	Donkey Kong games have always been more challenging than their Mario counterparts.
0	In fact the developers wanted so bad for this to be obvious that during these choices it's obvious that the good choice is selected with the A button and the evil choice is selected with the X button because on the screen the A button is surrounded by a pixie dust halo and the X button is surrounded by flames.
2	The environment in general is realistic, using detailed textures, building models, breakable doors, windows, and a bunch of smaller items like trashcans and luggage carts.
-1	The average latency is something like 150 even for fast broadband connections.

2	Excellent stuff all of the way around.Gameplay - 4:Its smooth stuff and I mean that earnestly.
0	The story take some element from games like Modern warfare, with traitors and conspirators.

-2	As a general rule, Japan is a good place to look for video game innovation, but as with all general rules, the exceptions tend to stand out, bold and glaring, and one of the brightest such exceptions on Nintendo's DS platform comes in the form of Nintendo's first-party word game CrossworDS.

2	The one thing everybody would agree with in Oblivion is that the graphics are absolutely first class.
1	You can easily tell which areas are valleys (obviously by the green shading and the boulders on screen---some even attack you), and which areas are mountainous (by the wind blowing and snow rushing past your active character---or perhaps even by all the white stuff weighing down on the barren trees,) like on Death Peak.Other special effects are added when Crono or any other of your party members (or enemies even) make a magical attack on the battlefield.

0	I have a 2.53GHz P4, 1G RAM and an NVidia 7600 GS video card.
0	You have three types of serving, but these three have different buttons and require use of the directional stick.

2	First let me start off by saying that any true fan of the Tony Hawk series will love this game.
0	If you do get that car, it's a good chance that person is going to come after you on foot and if you hit somebody's car, that person will get out their car picking a fight.
0	The other weapons are a hammer, axe and a knife which all break apart from a knife.
-2	The strategy element isn't obtrusive to the flow of the game, but tracing crucial intercept paths through small asteroids can be frustrating.
0	"Other stages require players to fly through ""beacons"" in order to catch up to and shoot down missiles that are headed for the Great Fox."
-1	But, it is possible to get used to these sound issues, and they become small problems.
-2	Overall, I don't really like this mode too much because it takes too long to develop.
1	Here you can race the CPU and there are many options that you can choose from.
0	Some of the missions include, power sliding so many times in a particular track, using stars to run into things, throwing those turtle shells at the mole things, and getting through all of the checkpoints in a particular track.

0	Oh well, at least you can use him in the other modes of play.
-2	 The developers definitely should have run more testing on this.
0	One should also be warned that certain characters are easier to use than others.
-1	This severely limits the number you can earn in one day, and lengthens gameplay.
-2	"That means if you have a Pikachu, you won't be hearing any ""pika pika""s. Still most of the calls are acceptable, although some of the electric creatures have some real shrill sounds emanating from them."
-2	Due to bad graphics, bad control, virtually no replay value, no 2-player mode, no Arena features, and having disgraced the name of SEGA, I say avoid this game.
1	If you dont like how there set up then you can easily change them.
-1	With the exception of being longer and requiring healing during battle, these fights are mostly exercises in button-mashing too.
-2	If you can actually find someone who owns an N-gage, and even bothered to buy this game, (both odds against you very much so!
-2	I hate when that happens.
-1	You might be able to win your first series of races, but not even halfway through the game does the gameplay become very difficult.
2	Not many gamers seem to have taken nicely to VF3tb, yet I'll still defend it until my dying day, because while it may not come close to the greatness of it's predecessor, it's still an excellent fighting game if you are actually willing to devote some time and effort to becoming good at it.
0	Dragon Warrior III...
-1	If you wish to get on with the story and shoot through the levels, you can get stuck into the puzzles without hesitation.
2	However, where Midway's game didn't survive the tampering, Rare's actually holds up pretty well when it comes to gameplay, especially considering more experienced companies in the field of fighters have messed up handheld transitions of their franchises.
-2	Instead the series was represented by a half-baked upgrade to a pretty shoddy game from the last generation of consoles.
2	Controls The controls in Crazy Taxi are pretty simple.
1	Funny enough right?
0	Controlling the game can quite easily be done on the standard Dreamcast pad, although seeing as I own one, I figured I should play it with my awesome arcade stick that I usually use for fighters.
2	It may not have had the 'WOW' impact to ensure it got full marks, but I still enjoyed it a hell of a lot, and it makes for a fun 2-Player, so combining that with my fandom for big robots sees to it that the game succeeds in attaining a solid 4/5.
2	Rather over-sized, but it's still the most accurate depiction of anything from the movies to feature in gameplay(the pictures in the opening sequence and item select menu are pretty well done).
0	It is slightly easier to angle the ball cross-court in doubles matches, but that's just natural.
0	The cats will also follow the arrows too but if they run into an arrow that points in the opposite direction, it will grow smaller and disappear if hit again in that manner.
2	WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS: Yes, there's always those little extras that make games more enjoyable.
-2	WHAT'S THAT?
