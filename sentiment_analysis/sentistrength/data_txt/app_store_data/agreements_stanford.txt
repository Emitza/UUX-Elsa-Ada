-1	Add the tap to load or swipe down to load options!
1	Addictive I love to pin the things that interest me and watch as other people enjoy my pinning.
1	Additionally, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date.
-1	After I did the update it will not open.
-1	After the last update, it crashes every time I open the manual upload.
-1	After this latest update I can't even get into my account on either my iPhone or iPad it says incorrect password!!!
-1	After you beat level 22-2 it freezes and doesn't give you the points for the level

-1	All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want.
-1	All the notebooks are there but they are all empty.
-1	All these updates, and I still can't rename things?
0	All you need for decorating pictures is in this app
1	Allow users to force a sync!
1	Also an improvement in the media player would also help.
-1	Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing.
-1	Also its more cumbersome to swipe through images since it's only responsive on the top half of the screen instead of the whole screen.
-1	Also like web integration.
-1	Also lost the ability to export into pages for editing.
-1	Also makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer since I never seem to move them.
1	Also makes preparing a menu easier!
-1	Also pinning things from all over the internet.
-1	Also please stop auto loading of images in feed section.

1	Also, I love the new interface.
-1	Also, I think it would be really fun if you incorporate a doodling function in Evernote.
-1	Also, I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline.
1	also, it'll be cool to add videos!
-1	Also, still not able to rename files -- unbelievable!!
-1	Also, the button for it is right under the pause button, which made me use it even more, I am now out of uses simply because they put it in a lousy location.
-1	Also, there is no logic behind the new tag section.
-1	Also, using the same view in landscape mode is really ugly and wastes screen real estate.
-1	Also, when reviewing I can rate different categories on the iPhone instead of just an overall rating on the iPad.
2	Always find fun things to do and good food.
-1	Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient.
2	Always works as promised and delivers useful info and travel tips!

1	Amazing ;-) Amazing app ... the best way to stay in touch with ur frnd.. sharw images ... videos .

1	An extra I really like are the street maps and metro guides.
1	And great that it has desktop integration for a computer.
-1	And help me with ideas for parties and all kinds of gathering and celebrations.
-1	And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities.
1	And it's free!
-1	And just a user friendlier way to change settings and customize/add pictures to your boards.
-1	And now it says trouble reaching evernote server.
-1	And now we also can't see our notes on the map filtered by tag.
1	And please, add the ability to tag photos and video.
1	And subcategories.
-1	And the new power of the red bird, directional targeting, kinda goes against the appeal of the original game -- you fire a bird and can't change it's direction.
1	And the voice recognition is great!
-1	And then I logged into my account through the website and no notes are there either...
-1	And they even have an app that loads to your phone and no data is required (as long as you load the city before you use it)
-1	And when you email or cut&paste into something else - it is a nightmare.
-1	And why do you want me to register???
-1	And you can even try to find the hidden items too.

-1	But with this new upgrade requiring iOS 7 (which I don't have), and many apps supporting other cloud storage providers, I find I may have to switch to Box, SugarSync, Mega, Mozy, or any of the other cloud storage sites who aren't forcing me to upgrade to iOS 7.
-1	But, one thing that's still missing is bulk downloads.
