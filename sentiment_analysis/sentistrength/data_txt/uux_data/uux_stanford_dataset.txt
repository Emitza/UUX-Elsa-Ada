-1	From the Beauty of the Citadel's updated look, to the Combat system, it has me hooked.In this series of games, you are always allowed to customise your character, your diolauge, your moral standards, your armor, your weapons, and your love interests.in this game you play as Commander Shepard (Either male or female, I play female), who, depending on your choices, is a sole survivor, a war hero, or relentless.

1	I can see how it was a classic on the original Playstation for its originality and epic appeal.
-1	You also have to, like in all other Zelda games, constantly be thinking because there are many puzzles in which the gamer has to overcome.
-1	The only problem I have with these cards is that some people can become too distracted with reading every card that passes through their hands that it makes a quick card game last forever.
-1	Still, I picked it up basically for free awhile back and gave it a try.
-1	At first it's fine but later on you need to find seven at a time and with no indication to where this last keycard is the game begins to abuse your mind as you scrub the landscape for it, only to get lost for an hour.
-1	The coolest feature for these weapons is being able to use them against the bosses.
-1	Super Mario All Stars brings the best of Marios first adventures to your Super Nintendo (Snes) and retro system.Super Mario All Stars is a collection of Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Bros 2 (Japanese version), Super Mario 2 (US version), and Super Mario 3.
0	Kya: Dark Lineage is a 3d platformer game for the PlayStation 2.
-1	I most like when the toys attack you on following stages because it's fun to smack Mr. Potatohead in the face and see his face pieces go flying (The single entertaining kill in the game) The problem with the game is that every stage has to be played a certain way, so to finish it you have to master the technique for every stage which is usually very boring.
-1	Of note, this series is in no way appropriate for kids - I don't even let them go into my bedroom when I'm playing it, between the gore, language and nudity.
-1	I hate them most of the time.
0	Gameplay - 4: I have to mark the game down a tad here.
-1	There were a couple of activities where I was trying to get him to do things, and he would drag a bit, but for the most part the EyePet remained pretty engaging.
-1	It's really, really not my cup of tea, but then I bought it for my kids, and all three played for varying lengths of time - though none of them 'completed' all of the objectives.
-1	Sometimes a name sounds a bit odd, like it's been shoehorned into the sentence - which obviously it has, but this is rare.
-1	There's of course most of the standard modes like quickplay, a franchise/association, create a player, online quick matches, online leagues, minigames/drills and so on.
-1	Following this release developer Ubi Soft announced a supposed return to form for the limbless Rayman subtitled 'Origins.
1	The layouts are well thought out and often make you think on your feet.

-1	Unfortunately it doesn't work because every two seconds there's a random encounter.
-1	Difficulty: I havent found this game to be overly difficult for the setting I chose, and feel this game can be played by about any type of gamer.
-1	There's a Golden Bullets Mode where all of your bullets kill enemies in one shot at the cost of Rubi having much less endurance.
-1	Sadly, there is no real story in Metroid, outside of the awesome story given in the instruction booklet (and a short but cool one in the intro if you wait a bit), but story generally was not part of the gameplay in NES titles (the Ninja Gaiden games being an obvious exception) so that's to be expected.
1	After Ultima II took place on Earth, Ultima III returns to the land of Sosaria where the player's goal is to defeat the game's antagonist and namesake, Exodus.
1	The Morph Ball is one such ability and was one of the main concerns players had before Metroid Prime's release.
-1	This is probably for the best because there's no feasible way to explain how the various Sega mascots have come together.
1	It's actually really nice not having to worry about being hit by a blue shell moments before crossing the finish line, and this is an absolutely huge advantage that Sonic and crew have over Mario.
-2	This is made less painful by the fact that you are allowed to retry should you lose, but at the same time, it seems completely unnecessary for the battle to end should the one character you have control over die.
1	The battle theme is amongst my favorites in the entire series - I think it fits the fast pace of the game very nicely with its high tempo and chaotic atmosphere.
1	The artists behind the game made excellent use of lighting and shadows, and they were way ahead of their time when compared to most every other game out back then.
2	I recommend simply going with a pre-loaded history.
-2	The first time I fired up Origins and saw I only had three classes, I was disappointed.
-1	Dragon Age 2 takes place within a single city-state (ignoring the introduction of the game).

-1	Not for a good year or more after it is released, and even then, only second hand.
1	One of my favorites genres of video games is the dungeon crawler.
-1	Its not flawless, but the passage of time has been mostly kind to Master Chiefs Xbox debut.

-1	I have not tried to move more than 2 into one house but it is on my list to try.
0	This is about as racy as the game gets.
1	Shipping was super fast, I received it in three days.
1	Thankfully the sequel was a huge improvement, and I would more than likely agree that game revolutionized the side scrolling brawler, as well as it being an all time Sega great.
-1	The rest of the game is made up of QTE (Quick Time Events), meaning that you have to follow the on-screen prompts to survive.
1	Still, overall Id rate the graphics as good.
-1	Another problem with the game is that its very short, with each episode taking maybe an hour and a half to two hours, making the total playtime about six to eight hours which, with the distinct lack of replay value, isnt very much.
1	The pacing isn't as tight as what you remember from Arkham Asylum, but the trade-off is worth it on the whole.
-1	Even then, it seems a little phoned-in this time around.
0	Presentation-wise the game is a mixed bag.
1	well Bethesda took that formula and fixed everything people complained about and made Skyrim.
-1	The AI are pretty smart and will try to flank your position and if you dont watch your back youll more than likely get surrounded and overwhelmed resulting in death.
1	But it's fun.
1	The characters use the 3D in their polygonal look and the lively sprites have some depth to them.
-1	That may seem familiar, but the environment of Arkham City is now five times larger than Asylum and so control of Batman has been improved to accommodate this.
-1	"Many people believe that this game ruined many of the theme, the key one being the ""cornered"" theme."
-1	GraphicsGraphics are again the same as Haulin' and American Long Haul.
1	There are numerous occasions of epicness in the game.
-1	At times, I just found these to be too distracting from the main game, and the story as well as pacing was kind of hurt.
-1	Kill Confirmed requires you to collect the dog tags of murdered players in order for the kills to count.

1	) I found that Madden 2005 was a bigger, updated retreat of Madden's trademark slippy, unrealistic arcade gameplay while ESPN 2K that year was (and still is) the finest football game ever made.
-1	At last, 2K Sports has made a football game in which using a zone defense isn't just for people who like to give up first downs.
1	Gears of War 3 has a great storyline, despite it's shortness.
-1	The story all ties in with its predacessors and made me feel like I was Fenix.

-1	I didn't really liek the first one.
1	Playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 on Play Station Online is by far the most fun video game to play online for the Playstation 3.

0	The Wii-Mote system throws all that out the window.

-1	Figuring out how to rewind the world around these items is the key to retrieving the puzzle pieces.
-1	The original seven fighters had their reasons for combat that was only spelled out if you let the original arcade game sit in attract mode.

1	A Year Without Rain 2.
-1	For example, in the beginning of the game, you have the simple slash attack.
-1	It wouldn't be fair to compare it to, for instance, the latest FIFA or PES games because it's aiming to be a completely different gaming experience (plus, it's created by a single person instead of a huge team!).

1	Another competitor can really screw you by placing a splitter in the power line and tying up a high value multiplier for more turns than you want.
-1	Other than a neat trailer for the second game and a couple difficulty settings there really isn't any reason to play the game over again.
-1	The tense moments are not shattered by jokes and the humours moments are not shattered by darkness.
1	My favorite was the negotiator rocket launcher, plasma monsters, and the electric net.

-1	Worse yet, several of the towns locals are in the forest with him and they seem to have gone a little mad the once friendly small town folk are now trying to chop him to bits.From the start you begin finding pages from a novel that Alan has not yet written, but under the title that he had decided on long ago for his next novel Departure.
1	What makes this cool is the fact that most of whats on the tube is shot in live action, including interviews with Alan Wake himself who is played by a real life actor during these sequences.The soundtrack is another high point here.

-1	This way you can catch piscine prizes to transform your dog or cat (or boar, fox or drone) into something useful.
-1	You can customize the settings on your account that will filter out any profanity that is spoken in the chat.

0	This game demands a fair amount of technique and it doesnt take long to get noticeably better at it which makes surpassing your high score a very addictive carrot dangled in front of your face.
-1	100,000 points are added if you clear the orange pegs on your first try, 50,000 on your second and 25,000 on your third.

-1	The original Super Mario Land is not one of my favorite games.
-1	Things start off normal enough with your trademark goombas and koopa troopas, but once you start delving deeper into the game you'll find some rather unorthodox enemies for a Mario title.
1	What I do like is the fact that the sound effects are significantly improved from the first Land game, and are now much more fitting a Mario title.

1	"There is an extras icon that will take you to another menu with different rooms of the house, the shop, games, customize, shows that you can enter for a fee, and friends where the it will ask you if ""you want to turn on DS wireless communications to find a PurPal."
-1	Compared to even Mass Effect it doesnt compete, but it is tolerable after playing for a bit.
0	Then some bad news surfaced.
1	Terminal Reality did a great job with the character graphics.
1	That said, on a technical level the game is a mixed bag some things look good, such as the character models of the major players, which carry realistic facial expressions, eye movements, and the like.
-1	Even the game ends in almost the exact fashion, which calls into question how much the developers really spent time into making the single player experience superior to the first when all they did was retread the same points again.
-1	The whole reason I ACTUALLY bought my XBox 360 was initially for Forza 2.
-1	Once you're there you get introduced to the announcer.

1	Also, with so many different characters with different moves will take a lot of playing to master everyone.
-1	Certain characters have better combos than others depending on their alliances.
-2	It's fair to say that this title is better equipped as a torture device than a form of entertainment and I'm here to tell you why.A Witch's Tale follows the exploits of a brash young witch named Liddel.
-1	Practically NEED FOR SPEED SHIFT good picture performance needs an equivalent PC.
1	Nevertheless, the regular setting is challenging and fun enough.
1	And I mean not enjoy in terms of not being able to enjoy the scenery, the character articulation, or even try to work your way through the levels slowly to find all the hidden intel items and such.
-1	They make the action sequences too fast that you just have to spray, pray and run - all to be rewarded with a slow animated death sequence in many of the chapters.
1	Sometimes, you will feel overwhelmed, like the game is throwing more at you than you can handle without taking serious damage.There are some changes that I find to be purely positive, though, like the improvement on graphics.
0	For 3,000 points.
-2	The other thing that can be annoying to some is that a lot of time is spent upside down and sideways.
1	The storytelling also takes a bit of a hit and in some cases you may not be sure exactly what is happening and how you are effecting the big picture.

-1	Cafe mode has six different stages and three different difficulty levels.
-1	All in all the audio wasn't all that great.So I went on playing this game thinking well graphics and all this do not matter as long as the game play good.
0	You fight across 6 different worlds, each with 5 stages apiece.
-1	Sure a large explosion would take away from the gameplay in situations where it would mask incoming enemies, but at least I would have liked to see a more satisfying explosion from the end of stage bosses.
2	I have heard some of what they say, and its very clever, but I wish the game had an option to adjust the music/effect/voice sounds.Other than that, the characters play their parts very well and they are instantly memorable and recognizeable.
-1	There are times that the motions on the TV don't react quickly enough to what we are doing with the remote.
1	These dreams are text-based stories and will convey an event that happend in one of your character's past.

1	It's all up to you.
-1	There are periodic updates which are dictated by an in-game voting mechanism.
-2	There is no penalty for uncovering or not uncovering the map and it really only serves to let you know where the other civilizations are, which is not pertinent information.
-1	The localization is better as well-the majority of the original game's painful dialogue segments have been updated and the result is a much more somber experience.
-1	"When this game originally came out, it also offered weekly downloadable puzzles for free for 33 weeks, but of course thats long over; however, the sequel, which was just released in the U.S. in September 2009 (there are already FOUR installments in Japan), is now doing the same thing, so thats a nice extra."
1	The Margot character is your host for all of the games and is a fairly cute, cartoonish character.
-1	For instance, the day stages are extremely fast paced with the goal being to complete the level in the shortest amount of time while dodging obstacles and defeating enemies.
-1	Collectables such as artwork or movie clips can be obtained.
1	It is by far worth it.
0	This comes about through the prize system.
1	The more you play, the more chances you have to win items that can be equipped to your character.

-1	But, if you own a PS3, Fuel really just can't compare to the more intense racing experience of Motorstorm, or the sequel Pacific Rift.
1	Most of what you will hear is Barbie and other characters talking, and a lot of music because this game is pretty much based on the dancing and music.
-1	So I believe that this game could be very helpful with problem solving skills as well.
-1	The other way around is obviously a loss.
1	Graphic details are well constructed.
-1	"Explore mode gives your child open access to the games and activities in discovery worlds of their choosing.According to Knowledge Adventure there are 30+ games and adventures, 50+ learning lessons, and 75+ fundamental skills ""taught"" in this game."
1	My kids like the bug catcher game and the monkey drop the best.
-1	Up close it's ear shattering rapid fire, you can even hear the bullets wizzing by your head and hitting whatever you're taking cover behind.
-1	The main reason that this was done was because not a whole lot of people ever played Hitman: Codename 47 and started with Hitman 2, so this game kind of cleared up everything for them without making them go backwards in the series.
-1	Static betting patterns just make it easy to bleed away cash and play the percentages to your favor until they're bankrupt.
-1	For those of you looking for a long term poker fix, will probably want to get an iPhone or iPod Touch and just connect to online poker apps instead.

0	You'll get amped the longer you last.
0	It is not the first of the series, unless your in America.
-2	Combine this with the rather plain visual effects and animations, and you have a game that isn't particularly engrossing, except from a strategic perspective.In addition, the game's interface could use some work: the audio prompts for party invites and chat messages are easily missed.
2	This makes you stronger, more deadly, and gives you energy to preform very power full attacks.What I thoughtThis is a fun H-N-S game that provides lots of fun.
-1	My final words are this game is fun, but it is short (around 9 hours of gameplay) I would not pay over $17.00 for this.
-1	While guitars have players playing 1-3 notes at a time, drums also does this, except you're using both hands and a foot.
1	The ones that impressed me most were New York Square on New Years Eve and Asgard.
-1	As the main character and his friend Miki pass a leisurely afternoon, Miki suddenly collapses from an unknown illness.
-1	"Advances dialogue during cut scenes; B Button = Cancel menu/command selections."
1	Overall the sound for Red Faction is pretty good, there really Isn't anything to complain about.
-1	Te players sometimes do rather baffling things but in general their actions are quite realistic, and the rules are well implemented apart from the offside rule being rather harsh and penalties often being given when the challenge definitely looked like it was just outside the box.The game seems to have a few stability issues running under 64-bit Vista, I've had quite a few crashes.
0	I had this happen to me last night multiple times.
-1	Characters I've always hated SF3 for getting rid of most of the classic characters.

1	And the fact that there are many things to do in each adventure makes it all the more fun.
-1	It is quite hard, you must able to survive for 30 minutes, against a wave of enemies whose appear periodically.To be able to defeat enemies,you must build a defensive tower.
-2	Read on and find out what I think of the latest addition to the series of one of the worlds' most played games.RequirementsIf you check the back of the game cover you'll find something like:Windows XP:CPU: 2ghzRAM: 1 GBGPU: 128MB of video memoryWindows Vista:CPU: 2ghzRAM: 1.5 GBGPU: 128MB of video memoryI tested this game on a one and a half year old laptop (for details, see http://www.epinions.com/content_455418941060) and I must say that it's playable, yes, but in a game like Sims where you often look at your characters and objects up-close one will probably want to have high texture and sim detail as well as edge smoothening.
-1	On my laptop mentioned above, the default settings that were automatically optimized by the game for my computer were mostly on medium but edge smoothening was set to off.
1	You can also do a color change on it, as is the case with most of the objects as well.
0	Grim took the old ones.
-1	You can play one section of a song over and over, or the whole song with a no-fail option.
-1	The only drawback is a couple of songs, like Metallica, wasn't part of the transfer due to some legalities.I have found that songs that I hated on the radio, I love playing and visa versa.
-1	When you're facing a wrestler, guess what you're going to be doing?
0	Star Ocean: Till the End of Time definitely had(has) promise.
1	At least with the normal mode the game allows you to be harmed and if you manage to keep away from the colossus in a safe area for awhile your health will go back up again.
0	With the ability to fight in a weight category either side of your original one (barring the Heavyweight and Featherweight categories, which only have one direction to move to).
2	This game is suitable for ages 18 and up, because of it's language and it's content.
2	"The world of ""Nightopia"" looks okay, with the 3D feeling solid enough without anything looking particularly impressive, and there is some level of creativity in the game world and level design."
-1	As a die hard fan I would purchase the game again without thought!
-1	Because the view is not set up as split-screen, this sometimes means that you have to convince your playing partner to move the other character forward so you can see where you're trying to go.There is occasionally the need for cooperation even in the single-player mode.
0	However, that doesn't mean that the older ones aren't classics in and of themselves.In this 3-D story, Nancy is invited onto the set of one of the hottest soap operas to track down what appears to be an enraged stalker.
1	If you just bought or rented the brilliant film to watch with your kids, and you thought it would be a good idea to buy the game for some extra fun, you would be very wrong.
-1	Do not buy this game.
-1	I want to actually dive in and hit buttons to swipe my sword and cast magic in real time.
1	There are a few twists on that perspective too.
1	There is also a survival and time trial modes in these games to.
-1	Speaking of the strum bar, I have a second after market controller.
-1	Most of the time the puzzles are limited to level memorization - the game contains several areas in which you have to either collect items or activate switches to proceed.
1	And with this game there are so many warriors to choose from (including female characters) that you are actually getting about 10 games for the price of one.
0	I must say that I LOVE the Sims Games.
-1	Unlike most RPG's (which typically use a somewhat-cumbersome text menu system), the game uses an intuitive visual GUI for its battles.
-1	"The collector's edition of Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, in addition to the two CD's the game is on, comes with two additional disks: One being the game's soundtrack (playable on any CD player) and the other being a cute ""Making Of"" documentary, chronicling the game's development and localization."

1	You have a wrist-watch, and you must pay attention to the time.
1	Always train on your physical traits, like body, arms, neck and feet to earn points to build up your stats.

1	The orchestrated soundtrack fits the theme of hacking-and-slashing Dracula's minions.
-1	And that is of course an AI partner controlled friend, there is nothing that can ruin a good RPG then a partner that is supposed to be helping you but instead makes you feel like your babysitting a 5 year old with mental problems, on top of battling blood thirsty monsters.
-1	You run through the various environments which include African villages, laboratories etc blasting away oncoming infected natives, super sized Alligators, deformed bats, and every other twisted creature the game throws at you.

1	If this is your first racing game, or if you don't have PGR3, it is a lot of fun and I would recommend it.
-1	It'll be like bringing the whole arcade home with you.LIST of FIGHTERS (in Alphabetical Order)...Abel*Akuma**BalrogBlankaCammy**Chun-LiCrimson Viper*Dan**DhalismE.HondaEl Fuerte*Fei Long**Gen**Gouken***GuileKenM.
-1	"Note that in some cases they expect you to ""dodge"" incoming objects, but that is the extent of your actual flying these levels.Blast storm troopers/droids with your blaster -- On some of these levels you get cover to shoot from which makes it easier but still a challenge because you can get hit from 3 different angles usually."
-2	).Fly insane courses and possibly shoot same time -- By far these are the most frustrating levels to a player.
-1	If you liked it, you could get the Anniversary Edition later.
-1	While via the F9 key you can change this view (from behind, top down, etc) in practice only 1st person view works because this allows you to see possible trouble coming in time to do something about it.Even with just the zones that are included in this Evolution software, there so many zones you can go to.
-1	I almost wish you could just hit, pitch, and get on to the next game.
-1	I like to look for places where there are more than one fish.
1	The graphics are just astonishing.
1	The instruments are very easy to set up as well.
1	"I think what really got to me is the whole ""Pokemon"" mentality of Portable Ops."
0	Needless to say, it'll help to have two players for this mode, but it's still possible to get by on your own, though definitely a lot harder.
-1	You get hints that you are tracking an animal though, and your crosshairs turn red when approaching one.
-1	Tastes differ but no one can say that isn't a good game .I RECOMMEND IT!
1	Selling it is your best option here, and you will have to sell a lot of pinatas if you plan on getting anywhere in this game.
-1	To get rid of a red candy you have to whack it with the shovel.
-1	You can easily see the notes flying down the screen, so less errors can be blamed on the game itself.Although the pricetag is heavy, it is well worth every cent to buy this bundle.
-1	Easy mode limits the notes youre given to only three colors out of five that are located on your guitar controller.
-1	I was also a bit frustrated that star notes disappear when you activate star power.
0	However, the flashes of images do not do a good job of giving the plot unless you recognize them from the episode.
-1	Currently there are no plans to offer co-op play in the game which I hope will change, as being able to play the game with friends and connect via a Blu Tooth would truly make this game standout.
-2	I really like Kurtis Stryker, who is apparently a police officer on Earth, and his machine gun and grenade throws are challenging against any opponent.
1	If there is a north on top and a free north that is good.
-1	I had been playing City of Heroes(a different MMORPG) for almost 3 years solid and was growing a bit bored of the game.
0	.

2	I loved this feature as I have 3 kids.
-1	"Your Attack Plays Out in a Cinematic, Slow-Motion SpectacleWhen you've queued up all the shots you want to take (usually limited to around 3), you hit an ""accept"" button and just watch the action you've coreographed play out in slow motion."

-1	Just run up to your enemy and swing a baseball bat at him until he's dead.
-1	Other interactions are just off... you can enter someone's house while they're asleep, go up to their bed and click to talk to them.
0	Do you play the good guy?
1	Fallout 3 is the kind of game that makes you forget to eat as well as the time of day.
-1	I found it disappointing once I was done buying everything, but its better than the alternative problem found in other lego games it takes forever to earn enough currency for all of the unlockables!
1	Newer gamers might think this is a bit cheesy, but to us gaming veterans, this game is well worth the price of admission.
1	List of Power upsCrush- missiles that travel a short distance but are very powerful Flame- a spinning fireball Homing heat seeking missiles Laser- a straight energy beam Machine gun very fast reddish orange circular bullets Spread shot- like the machine gun but bullets go out in a wider triangular shaped pattern.
-1	Each surfer has his own range of abilities including speed and freestyle ability, and there are a selection of boards which also add to or detract from your different abilities.
1	There are a lot of control movements and buttons you have to memorize and if you dont memorize them its timely to stop and read the instructions in between each event.
1	Renamed Blackrock Studios, the new team releases perhaps one of the greatest ATV titles to date.
-1	While the racing portion is good, though, the freestyle mode is an addictive blast.
-1	It's tolerable and probably better than half the crap EA has subjected us to in recent times.
-1	While there are a couple of issues, like the AI balancing and some repetition in events, it doesn't make Pure that much less of a fun game to play.
-1	"Sands of Time gave the player limited ability to ""rewind"" those goofs to try again (effectively streamlining the age-old conceit of having ""extra lives"")."
0	Defeat means being sprawled face down on the ground.
-1	This game is rife with them.
-1	In a word, showtime mode is absurd.
0	You can give the baby fruit, vegetables, milk, soy milk, chocolate milk and so on.
1	For instance a full set of action points will net you about 4 shots with a pistol (or bursts with an automatic weapon) and 2 shots with a sniper rifle.
-1	While there aren't nearly as many missions as there were in Oblivion, the missions that do exist have many more legs to them and take much longer to complete.
-1	Find your father and find out why he suddenly ditched the vault without warning.
-1	The underground metro system serves as the dungeons of the game, and also are the only way initially into the remains of Washington DC.
1	The game definitely shines with the graphics and the sound doesn't disappoint either.
-1	You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game.
-1	In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods.
1	Setting up the future of the team is almost as important as playing the current season, and NCAA 2008 gives players the chance to do everything and more.
1	Still, with the amount of content that is added to the game with the extra interviews, one bonus mission for each character, pictures from the movies, and concept art they did make an effort to add more playtime without just playing the game.
1	As a general rule, Japan is a good place to look for video game innovation, but as with all general rules, the exceptions tend to stand out, bold and glaring, and one of the brightest such exceptions on Nintendo's DS platform comes in the form of Nintendo's first-party word game CrossworDS.
0	Second, it seems as if they were working with a very limited color palette.
0	The final location is London and your mission list is much longer.
-1	However, that gets frusterating to correctly do later on, and you don't always kill them when you counter no matter how much you pound attack.The hidden dagger is my favorite.
1	Playing this game with the Classic Controller will definitely give you a better experience.The game starts off with a cut-scene explaining the story and the opening of the book by Jared.
-1	Some of these will send you off on quests and sub-plot arcs in order to retrieve information or objects for them.
0	Your ships pilot is voiced by Seth Green.
-1	If you are no good at it like me, then be careful to keep enough tickets to play the games you are good at or you could end up stuck.

-1	This advanced piece of technology doesn't include simple mapping software?And just... Really?We are used to certain contrivances peppering the virtual worlds of video games.
-1	When they are empty you are either dead or have no magic.
1	The one thing everybody would agree with in Oblivion is that the graphics are absolutely first class.
-1	You can easily tell which areas are valleys (obviously by the green shading and the boulders on screen---some even attack you), and which areas are mountainous (by the wind blowing and snow rushing past your active character---or perhaps even by all the white stuff weighing down on the barren trees,) like on Death Peak.Other special effects are added when Crono or any other of your party members (or enemies even) make a magical attack on the battlefield.
-1	Later levels took him through seedy dives, secret complexes, shootouts, sprawling high-rise urban warfare, law enforcement manhunts, break-and-enters, room-to-room fighting, and not one but four showdowns.
-1	So technically, you should be throwing open every door and killing every monster, but it doesn't force you to in order to move on.The stages actually aren't bad.
1	"Although the original Mario Kart and a bunch of follow-ups in the ""Mario Kart"" series preceded it, I actually enjoy ""Chocobo Racing"" more than I enjoy Mario Kart for the DS."

-1	You may be saying to your self, 4 Guitar Hero games (well, 2 for Wii, but I am talking overall), isn't this fad getting a little old???!!!
-1	Melee weapons can be swapped for another, i.e.
-1	The purpose of a bomb is to destroy all the enemies currently on the screen in your galaxy.
-1	I found /ttell useful as well in the case of hard to spell names, as this tells your message to your target.
-1	I played this game on the keyboard incidentally (lack of a working joystick at the moment and disinclination to spend money on one!
-1	As always, GH:A uses the PS3 Les Paul guitar, or, if you're weird, the Dual Shock 3 to hit colored notes and try not failing and shaming your family.
0	However, having played the game since the closed beta of the original, I have to say that I had a lot more fun in the Old World, with the level range stuck at 1-60.
2	All in all, this is an innovative game that brings play to a whole new level.
1	Now, in the real NBA, if you run play after play after play, the defense will catch on and here it doesn't, but I still enjoyed being able to run players off screens and get them open for shots.
1	Graphics The graphics of this game pretty much doesn't matter.
1	*, the story had me in powerful goosebumps for each person that came your way.
-1	The enemy AI is also horrible.

0	Overall, I don't really like this mode too much because it takes too long to develop.
0	Here you can race the CPU and there are many options that you can choose from.
1	Some of the missions include, power sliding so many times in a particular track, using stars to run into things, throwing those turtle shells at the mole things, and getting through all of the checkpoints in a particular track.
-1	Net - Use your net to catch bugs and butterflies(with the A button) You can donate them to the museum or sell them to Tom Nook Environment If you go to the town hall and talk to the character that is to the left of the desk.
1	And I might be mistaken, but I believe that the graphics have received a light sheen from the developers.
1	"Beating a cup guarantees a reward, but getting a ""silver"" or ""gold"" trophy (based on points), unlocks much cooler things."
-1	"What I was expecting when this one was first announced was a complete graphical rehaul; either by making everything polygonal, or at least adding a ton of sprites to some of the least intense sequences; battle maps for example."
1	Oh well, at least you can use him in the other modes of play.
0	 The developers definitely should have run more testing on this.
-1	One should also be warned that certain characters are easier to use than others.
1	This severely limits the number you can earn in one day, and lengthens gameplay.
0	"That means if you have a Pikachu, you won't be hearing any ""pika pika""s. Still most of the calls are acceptable, although some of the electric creatures have some real shrill sounds emanating from them."
-2	Due to bad graphics, bad control, virtually no replay value, no 2-player mode, no Arena features, and having disgraced the name of SEGA, I say avoid this game.
0	If you dont like how there set up then you can easily change them.
-1	With the exception of being longer and requiring healing during battle, these fights are mostly exercises in button-mashing too.
-1	If you can actually find someone who owns an N-gage, and even bothered to buy this game, (both odds against you very much so!
-1	I hate when that happens.
-1	You might be able to win your first series of races, but not even halfway through the game does the gameplay become very difficult.
1	Not many gamers seem to have taken nicely to VF3tb, yet I'll still defend it until my dying day, because while it may not come close to the greatness of it's predecessor, it's still an excellent fighting game if you are actually willing to devote some time and effort to becoming good at it.
1	Dragon Warrior III...
-1	If you wish to get on with the story and shoot through the levels, you can get stuck into the puzzles without hesitation.
-1	However, where Midway's game didn't survive the tampering, Rare's actually holds up pretty well when it comes to gameplay, especially considering more experienced companies in the field of fighters have messed up handheld transitions of their franchises.
0	Instead the series was represented by a half-baked upgrade to a pretty shoddy game from the last generation of consoles.
1	Controls The controls in Crazy Taxi are pretty simple.
1	Funny enough right?
-1	Controlling the game can quite easily be done on the standard Dreamcast pad, although seeing as I own one, I figured I should play it with my awesome arcade stick that I usually use for fighters.
1	It may not have had the 'WOW' impact to ensure it got full marks, but I still enjoyed it a hell of a lot, and it makes for a fun 2-Player, so combining that with my fandom for big robots sees to it that the game succeeds in attaining a solid 4/5.
1	Rather over-sized, but it's still the most accurate depiction of anything from the movies to feature in gameplay(the pictures in the opening sequence and item select menu are pretty well done).
-1	It is slightly easier to angle the ball cross-court in doubles matches, but that's just natural.
-1	The cats will also follow the arrows too but if they run into an arrow that points in the opposite direction, it will grow smaller and disappear if hit again in that manner.
1	WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS: Yes, there's always those little extras that make games more enjoyable.
-1	WHAT'S THAT?
