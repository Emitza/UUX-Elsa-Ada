becomes very tricky, and on occasion you may go mad trying to figure out why people hate your park despite every ride being more fun than winning the lotto, and with decent excitement ratings.	1	-1163384	You can also choose the length to hire the shooting specialist (the longer the length, the more dynasty points the specialist costs).	1	-1119801	I almost wish you could just hit, pitch, and get on to the next game.	1	-149446	Making the game more complicated are night levels.	1	-2129515	You play the protagonist Alex Sheperd, who goes back home to visit his family in Sheperd's

Mario Kart for the DS."	2	-1147568	Push the remote forward to barrel through defenders, sideways to stiff arm, shake the nunchuk to juke, lift both controllers to catch.	1	-1161764	Its also a good mix of old and new music, for example, they have Cherry Pie, but they also have Beast And The Harlot.	2	-1186935	And I might be mistaken, but I believe that the graphics have received a light sheen from the developers.	2	-1102744	It's all up to you.	1	-1165864	This game stays interesting because of the obstacles and special items.	2	-135771	The graphics are pretty good, with the Supermen and the enemies being fairly well detailed.	3	-172202	There area lot of new rifles/guns/melee weapons.	2	-1132695	I played this game on the keyboard incidentally (lack of a working joystick at the moment and disinclination to spend money on one!	1	-18669	The results were unbeatable, but putting it all together took one of those stubborn Im smarter than any stupid machine mentalities that entailed reconstructing the entire video from scratch to produce copies of the video for those who requested one.	1	-1105547	But, if you own a PS3, Fuel really just can't compare to the more intense racing experience of Motorstorm, or the sequel Pacific Rift.	1	-264305	First of all i would like to say without giving away any spoilers, that it was the worst ending of a game I have ever seen in my lifetime, and I've played a lot of games.	1	-4160690	Other thoughts: My main problems with this game were that the races were too long.	1	-4166339	This version comes with a mini replica of a Gibson X-Plorer guitar.	1	-196937	The game plays out like a bad episode of the X-files, and I dont mean that in a nostalgic way.	1	-2170631	It features such weapons as the Bio-Rifle, the Flak Cannon, and of course, the Rocket Launcher.	1	-162522	There are multpile sports to choose from and is suitable for all groups.	2	-144983	Even then, it seems a little phoned-in this time around.	1	-14448	Windows XP does have its flaws though... namely in the method of error reporting.	1	-4191683	The cats will also follow the arrows too but if they run into an arrow that points in the opposite direction, it will grow smaller and disappear if hit again in that manner.	1	-196576	The formula for ascending with the sword is pretty standard and static.	1	-167170	In the Honor roll section you can see your game progress.	1	-149049	The build time on this is about twenty minutes if you have some Lego experience, a little longer if you are new to the assembly process.	1	-120208	There is no box to check or uncheck so that this will disapear, unless you tell vista that you want to disable the security set up, in which case your Windows runs naked.	1	-3137251	But if you love party games, Rock Band is the way to go.	3	-135740	The Death and Return of Superman was developed by Blizzard Entertainment and published by Sunsoft for the Super Nintendo (SNES) in 1994.	1	-15610	Unfortunately this time, the feeling will be accompanied by a sense that this is really not necessary.	1	-2155799	#NAME?	1	-143995	Shipping was super fast, I received it in three days.	2	-1130113	Oh, the kamui aka throw-your-enemies-to-an-alternate-world is cool.	2	-1191044	Funny enough right?	2	-1116141	The orchestrated soundtrack fits the theme of hacking-and-slashing Dracula's minions.	2	-133518	Let the slow-motion rampaging begin...Before I say anything about the gameplay, let me emphasize how visually stunning MP3 truly is.	3	-196945	When all is said and done, what The Conduit ends up feeling like is a glorified tech demo.	3	-134313	All these scenes manage to do is throw off the games pacing and to be honest they are pretty boring.	1	-370603	She must deal with her family matters (ninjas), plus she and her butler type character both have the ability to teleport (no I am not making this up).	1	-1173604	(Too quiet at times.	1	-290436	The game is fun and has serious replay value.	3	-131586	There is also the choice to farm souls for hours on end and reach the highest Soul Level just as well as there is the option to defeat the game without leveling (remaining on Soul Level 1).	1	-1155855	In fact I just couldnt stop playing it for a long time.	3	-194476	Terminal Reality did a great job with the character graphics.	3	-195655	The whole reason I ACTUALLY bought my XBox 360 was initially for Forza 2.	1	-164746	Your teammate are smart too, making correct cuts to the basket and filling in the lanes.	1	-1131500	So technically, you should be throwing open every door and killing every monster, but it doesn't force you to in order to move on.The stages actually aren't bad.	2	-171087	This is part two all over again, only now the bosses are playable along with a few characters from the first game like the break dancing Duck King and martial arts master Tung Fu Rue.	2	-1107299	"Spartan ""Total Warrior"" is not a diamond by any means but, does shine more than most others I have played."	3	-1165932	While it is interesting and well told, it is a little bit too short.	3	-2121831	I was also a bit frustrated that star notes disappear when you activate star power.	3	-176932	Or else maybe youre one of the hundreds of millions of people in the world who dont give a flying Zubat about

up you pick a puppy and name it.	1	-172409	Once you get your characters equipped that sameness can change, as every weapon or piece of armor you wear is shown on your character.	1	-1159569	"Getting killed merely warps you to the nearest ""Vita-Chamber."	1	-1136433	Of course, two of these Mutants that he kidnaps is Polaris, a companion of the X-men, and Quicksilver, Magneto's son, so you can see how this affects both sides.	1	-1130887	This advanced piece of technology doesn't include simple mapping software?And just... Really?We are used to certain contrivances peppering the virtual worlds of video games.	1	-347582	At last, 2K Sports has made a football game in which using a zone defense isn't just for people who like to give up first downs.	2	-180856	Nope.	1	-3184627	The other weapons are a hammer, axe and a knife which all break apart from a knife.	1	-174500	As you increase in difficulty you'll get the standard type of changes such as foes taking more damage while Batman can take less.	1	-1121311	To get rid of a red candy you have to whack it with the shovel.	1	-1160323	Other times, when you don't want them to, they'll shoot at a rival gang, or a cop, and you'll have to deal with that, but it's better to have homies than not have them.	1	-1173031	The game follows the typical platformer setup: jumping, attacking and collecting.	1	-1157092	This typically happens when the content is loading in game, so it is restricted to transition phases.	1	-22440	Choosing to install the applets is simple and straightforward.	3	-175828	There's a quick travel option in Red Dead Redemption and I appreciate it.	3	-156437	Perhaps the game lacks a little atmosphere at times, but the intensity of the tennis matches themselves makes up for that and you definitely start to feel involved with what happens to your players.	4	-270158	Princess Zelda who was the wielder of the second one called the Triforce of Wisdom, shattered it into 8 pieces and hid them throughout Hyrule in 8 dungeons.	1	-1108328	This makes you stronger, more deadly, and gives you energy to preform very power full attacks.What I thoughtThis is a fun H-N-S game that provides lots of fun.	4	-1104545	Vs. (2-4 players) you race opponents through checkpoints, first to cross five wins.	1	-1138057	Sometimes I feel like I'm walking out of a casino.	2	-1124249	Just run up to your enemy and swing a baseball bat at him until he's dead.	1	-132679	You can also get the losers who think that since there is a microphone on there headset that everyone wants to hear their rants.	1	-345124	Presentation-wise the game is a mixed bag.	1	-277940	Pretty soon you discovery some weird phenomenon going on, and it turns out the facility was used to conduct time travel experiments.	1	-15858	I knew enough about camcorders to guess that I probably wouldn't get the kind that burns directly to DVD, but I didn't realize that our gift would end up requiring me to spend an hour on the phone with Costco tech support (thanks, Dan!	2	-1178534	The Dynamics On These Are A Bit Overboard As They Bounce And Jiggle In Different Directions For Each Breast (Note Tinas Look Like They Are Gonna Smack her In The Face.	1	-2115424	Roll them again.	1	-196044	It is particularly annoying towards the end of the last level where there is a long and difficult room to clear.	1	-331687	I am not the greatest videogamer in the world.	1	-2151226	The realism was taken to a whole new level with high polygon models, basic yet well defined textures, and enough environmental atmosphere to make it seem as if the course was real.	4	-1101124	GAMEPLAYBorderlands is a First Person Role Playing Shooter that features just about as much Role Playing Game leveling as Fallout 3 did.	2	-147734	The story all ties in with its predacessors and made me feel like I was Fenix.	3	-1124390	Other interactions are just off... you can enter someone's house while they're asleep, go up to their bed and click to talk to them.	1	-157021	The game basically works by each unit having a field of vision / attack range and a field of movement.	1	-1178273	A good example would be Zebras.	2	-1167486	The only thing that may be bad about little kids playing is that you are playing with and against other people and they can talk about, or ask you anything without a filter.	1	-3143130	I had a couple of the enemies villagers walking around and I had to track them down.	1	-181897	A family member gave the game to me on the Christmas of 2009 and I have been hooked ever since, the game has so many different features from the Sims 2, I think first we should go over traits and because of how many there are I am not going to slim it down Traits

challenge.	3	-1132774	As always, GH:A uses the PS3 Les Paul guitar, or, if you're weird, the Dual Shock 3 to hit colored notes and try not failing and shaming your family.	1	-196626	This would be great if the A had any semblance of I.	1	-1148481	Better spend some of your budget on military outposts and soldiers to man them or you won't survive a coup!	1	-1157972	I sent this to Best Buy last week and have not received a reply.	1	-2152679	The same thing happened.	1	-1119943	The graphics are just astonishing.	4	-1108141	It is not the first of the series, unless your in America.	1	-1181062	On 06 you could only kick a straight ball and hope one of your guys gets to it.	1	-1138570	You can also create Photos by unlocking backgrounds and all the other cars to make a photo.	1	-198704	As the waves progress, the more zombies are sent your way.	1	-160223	It was an integral part of the storyline.	1	-1139695	The enemies usually aren't intelligent enough to chase you beyond a certain point, so you can just lay low for a while, and attack over and over again for very easy kills.	1	-264048	Violin shrills warn you when a Witch is near, a short burst of the Trombone section commences on cue when the robust hulk like creature (Tank) comes barreling your direction, throwing anything heavy at you on its path to destroy anything ( being you) in its way.	1	-172227	I got Soul Calibur 4 a couple of months ago online when I found it dirt cheap.	1	-1110723	And the fact that there are many things to do in each adventure makes it all the more fun.	3	-142498	Dragon Age 2 takes place within a single city-state (ignoring the introduction of the game).	1	-141918	This is made less painful by the fact that you are allowed to retry should you lose, but at the same time, it seems completely unnecessary for the battle to end should the one character you have control over die.	2	-2139186	This game came around just in time.	2	-147731	Gears of War 3 has a great storyline, despite it's shortness.	4	-2172154	Happy Cooking!	1	-1173825	The wrestler lineup is pretty decent collection of stars from the 1970s and up.	3	-1178368	Gameplay As I already mentioned FFIX expands the number of characters in your party from three back to four.	1	-1174510	I'm a huge fan or the Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry series and always try to find games like those in some way.	3	-1182752	I like games a little longer, but 20 hours is not a short game by any means.	2	-14878	Every programmer with a slight bent towards the musical is popping one out, and the vast majority are either overpriced, underpowered, or underproduced.	1	-3119631	).Fly insane courses and possibly shoot same time -- By far these are the most frustrating levels to a player.	1	-342304	The first time I fired up Origins and saw I only had three classes, I was disappointed.	1	-3180184	It's composed well enough, but it just sounds archaic.	2	-2109435	Overall the sound for Red Faction is pretty good, there really Isn't anything to complain about.	3	-176779	The answer is it depends.	1	-1139817	It is well worth the time to play through all of the quests and took me a little over two hours to complete.	3	-171704	"Seeing an opportunity to expand upon how the Ys games worked, Falcom appears to have approached this latest outing with a ""change is good"" attitude."	2	-150185	I love going into the back floors and seeing what kind of rare items I can find.	4	-188210	I am really glad I gave this workout a chance.	3	-176174	Challenge You can only play this mode only if you complete the Adventure mode first.	1	-156891	Things start off normal enough with your trademark goombas and koopa troopas, but once you start delving deeper into the game you'll find some rather unorthodox enemies for a Mario title.	1	-253351	Other than a neat trailer for the second game and a couple difficulty settings there really isn't any reason to play the game over again.	1	-242661	I loved Dragon Age: Origins.	4	-1146511	"With all this in mind, it is not a BAD game- just a different game than I expected; a little more time consuming."	2	-2138949	The highest I got was 96%, theres so much to take in from a storyline perspective as well as the mini games involved like the races and rampages that you can go on.	1	-1157253	The front of the remote points at the screen and controls a marker that shows where youre aiming.	1	-167714	Before, many of the stats (such as Luck, Strength, etc.	1	-1166175	With the new Xbox live software including MSN messenger, it will be much easier to plan club/car meets with all of your friends because now you can bother them at home and at work.	3	-1169377	Essentially, there is no timeframe in the game and time neither begins or ends and you are forever lost in a time warp of boring, repetitive and certainly endless trips across America, hauling some fictitious loads of cargo for no apparent reason.	1	-464387	This weapon customization feature can be quite humorous as well, because you are given options like making all of your grenades gold and diamond-encrusted, or if you like the cheap look, you can add a screwdriver to your gun as a bayonet.	3	-139250	Sometimes a name sounds a bit odd, like it's been shoehorned into the sentence - which obviously it has, but this is rare.	1	-284082	And with the addition of more pro players and side games this years installment focused more on this.	2	-150847	This is presented using the third person format and plays a lot like one of the Assassin's Creed games, though the controls aren't as tight.	1	-136967	I can see how it was a classic on the original Playstation for its originality and epic appeal.	3	-1175847	The graphics and the sound are very well taken advantage of by the games boss characters who range from typical monstrosities to transforming Mecha taken right from your typical Japanese Anime.	3	-181291	I wont spoil it here.MW2 is different than other first person shooters because instead of it being one man against the whole world, it is literally a war zone.	2	-149017	Sound 4 out of 5 Castle Crashers sound is quite frankly nothing but Beatem Up arcade musical mastery.	1	-2140124	Well there are three distinct styles.	1	-169095	999 is a game that requires more than one playthrough in order to find out everything about the storyline.	2	-1108245	Combine this with the rather plain visual effects and animations, and you have a game that isn't particularly engrossing, except from a strategic perspective.In addition, the game's interface could use some work: the audio prompts for party invites and chat messages are easily missed.	1	-3156316	I personally loved the soundtrack for the most part until it broke into goofy early 90s style power rock during boss battles.	2	-3140489	Garages: Yep, you can still have them.	1	-1139280	One of the biggest changes from previous Grand Theft Auto games, is that now CJ can actually gain and loose weight during game play.	1	-269761	The minigames are all pretty fun the first few times around, but after that they get a bit boring and repetitive.	2	-233658	If you played the first two Max Payne games or love detailed combat and a lot of shooting, this is the game for you.	3	-1145484	When I went to the store to pick up a game, I wasn't sure what to get.	1	-1107914	Second, you really don't have a lot of control over the makeup of your roster but more on how you play the hand you are dealt.	1	-147327	Some execute different patterns of shooting various bullets or other objects at you, some spawn other enemies to swarm you, and some just try to run you over.	1	-191005	The story basically follows that of the 1995 movie Goldeneye.	1	-270075	Going through the store one day I picked up Imagine: Rock Star.	1	-1167863	About a week or two, or until the batteries died, I swear I dont know one kid who ever bought new batteries for that game.	1	-284626	It basically takes the theory of time being a fourth dimension and makes it literal.	2	-142033	The artists behind the game made excellent use of lighting and shadows, and they were way ahead of their time when compared to most every other game out back then.	4	-159573	It is not a change for the better.	1	-2124710	Fallout 3 is the kind of game that makes you forget to eat as well as the time of day.	3	-152751	While this seems like a way to score high, their destinations sometimes seem unfair as they are on opposite ends of the city.	1	-2110487	I had to laugh at how ridiculous that must have looked.	1	-290453	Grand Turismo 4 does not fall short of this yet again as it features over 700 cars from over 80 different manufacturers.	2	-1108871	The ones that impressed me most were New York Square on New Years Eve and Asgard.	3	-143845	This is about as racy as the game gets.	3	-187659	And why does he have a portal to his wife's bedroom that he clearly can't fit through?	1	-2143106	The Calvalry includes Hussar, Cuirassier, Cossack, Uhlan, Lancer, Oprichnik, Spahi, Calvalry Archer, Dragoon, Ruyter, and War Wagon.	1	-1126858	Defeat means being sprawled face down on the ground.	1	-2157647	I've noticed the enemies seem able to avoid you're targeting reticle through computer aid.	1	-196416	In Zelda Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Game cube) you controlled Link as both a child and adult.	1	-152617	Theres an underwater city that was designed to be the utopia for humanity.	1	-1105882	So I believe that this game could be very helpful with problem solving skills as well.	4	-189919	You will be instructed as to how and where to set up the camera.	2	-1161904	The foundry level is exquisite once you get past the opening segment and into the foundry courtyard.	3	-1152648	As druids have had a special place in my heart ever since I met Jahira in Baldur's Gate, I chose that occupation and moved on to selecting her avatar.	3	-172881	There is virtually no limit to what you can create.As you can see, there is just SO much to do.	3	-171413	The only downfall is that once and a while you can tell that the sounds are a few seconds behind what you are doing in the game.	1	-3126617	It's tolerable and probably better than half the crap EA has subjected us to in recent times.	2	-346977	GraphicsGraphics are again the same as Haulin' and American Long Haul.	1	-148236	I didn't really liek the first one.	1	-375052	In order to release Yoshi from his egg, Mario must go find the corresponding fruit that appears in a bubble above the egg.	1	-169918	I think the toy is too powerful.	3	-1139061	It seems like it is best suited for junior high aged kids as far being a tool for helping kids improve their math skills, however, most will find it boring or too challenging as a learning tool and not enjoy it.	3	-254975	The game is over when the eggs drop below the warning line.	1	-1173681	Gameplay: Fire Emblem has a large cast of characters and there are three main characters.	1	-179007	These things factor in towards what type of build a player might decide to go for.	1	-159319	Namely that will never happen.	1	-151396	In the end, I did not find any reason to watch the videos nor strive to unlock them.	1	-248013	My Nvidia GTX 460m graphics card and 6 gigs of RAM handled the game without a hitch.	3	-1104211	She often comes across as the conscience of the group, and is usually the first to offer help to those who need it.	1	-151751	Maybe try renting it first and seeing if this is a game of interest.	1	-158962	The first issue with Sheva is that she's a loot wh*re.	1	-397601	The female announcer from UT2003 brought a futuristic computer voice feeling to the series.	2	-1119028	I know I spend some time there.My Opinion:These games are all fun to play either in groups or alone.	3	-141486	This is probably for the best because there's no feasible way to explain how the various Sega mascots have come together.	3	-1187029	"Beating a cup guarantees a reward, but getting a ""silver"" or ""gold"" trophy (based on points), unlocks much cooler things."	2	-170940	Gameplay: Art of Fighting is a 2-D, two player game with 8 playable characters and two secret characters.	1	-1114481	You have a wrist-watch, and you must pay attention to the time.	1	-157095	"You can also choose to purchase a more recent version such as ""Fast Food Tycoon 2"".There are quite a few cheat codes on line that you might want to check out to enhance the fun of the game.For versatility, involved play and replay value, I give this game a ""thumbs up"".Ski Resort Tycoon is also a business sim; and the objective is to create and run your own ski resort and end up with a 5-star rating."	3	-1173748	However, it's play is engaging enough for any age to enjoy.	3	-14052	It's nice to be able to run Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and three other programs without expending all of my computer's resources, and this program is certainly streamlined enough to allow me to do that.	3	-150300	I even had one that said jump the shark.	1	-1160823	The online is pretty much like the DS games you need friend codes in order to actually book mark people and if you dont have any then its just random people.	1	-147782	Crygor then tells Wario to tilt the machine.	1	-1178541	Luckily Unlike Its Predecessor The Suits Are Not Thrown In The Bin.	2	-146872	"Many people believe that this game ruined many of the theme, the key one being the ""cornered"" theme."	1	-3186380	Some of the missions include, power sliding so many times in a particular track, using stars to run into things, throwing those turtle shells at the mole things, and getting through all of the checkpoints in a particular track.	1	-150057	They apparently lose just about as much life as you do, when you shoot at them, as you furiously pull the trigger twelve times at someone you know youre
