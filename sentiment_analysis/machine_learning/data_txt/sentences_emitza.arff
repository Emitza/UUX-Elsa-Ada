'id: 8 ',' Now I can  t play game at all. ','?'
'id: 8 ',' It crashes at opening every time!! ','?'
'id: 23 ',' Apple really needs to stop letting little kids write all of these infantile reviews for apps. ','?'
'id: 23 ',' Most of them don  t even know how to use spell check on their phone for heavens sake! ','?'
'id: 28 ',' I just love it! ','?'
'id: 28 ',' Please get more games soon, can  t take the wait! ','?'
'id: 32 ',' \\nHi, my aim has improved as has my ability to figure out how to get 3 stars on most all levels. ','?'
'id: 35 ',' All I get is "waiting" then failed to update. ','?'
'id: 38 ',' I updated my iOS software and it  s not that or my phone. ','?'
'id: 38 ',' I know you can do better, Rovio! ','?'
'id: 39 ',' Make it like better with a giant pig bigger than king pig. ','?'
'id: 42 ',' These screens are small enough without crowding in more "stuff"  Tuck it in with the rest of the add ons I never use and please get it out of my face! ','?'
'id: 49 ',' Dear Rovio; If you absolutely must continue trying to squeeze dollars from your customers this way, at least have the decency to include an opt out for those like myself who are absolutely NOT going to spend an amount equal to what I paid for the app in the first place just to have some gimmicky and expendable in game item. ','?'
'id: 56 ',' App crashes when new power up notice pops up. ','?'
'id: 62 ',' It would be nice to have an update that didn  t crash the app. ','?'
'id: 63 ',' App crashes with new release. ','?'
'id: 67 ',' I have had no problems with any of the versions so far. ','?'
'id: 68 ',' Please bring back the trajectory line or at least make it to where you can turn it on or off. ','?'
'id: 69 ',' This is not worth buying it will crash right from the beginning. ','?'
'id: 70 ',' I will say you should make shock so close to the other buttons because I like to use the birds you provide. ','?'
'id: 70 ',' That needs to change. ','?'
'id: 71 ',' Since the last update this game crashes constantly and is unplayable. ','?'
'id: 78 ',' But how much data do you need to make an animated toon for a 4 inch display? ','?'
'id: 79 ',' It has been cutting out and restarting in the middle of my games, so that I am unable to beat high scores or get more stars. ','?'
'id: 85 ',' So, I wish I could play, but the game crashes when I try to open a level. ','?'
'id: 90 ',' There is no other way to say it. ','?'
'id: 92 ',' Fantastic game can  t stop playing. ','?'
'id: 92 ',' Please find a new place to put the bomb power up. ','?'
'id: 92 ',' Or make it like star wars #1 where if you reset it gives it back to you if you don  t use it. ','?'
'id: 93 ',' Shockwave crashes on level 15 when gas and shock items both hit the piggies in the far right corner. ','?'
'id: 94 ',' Great new levels and power up with the electric bomb bird, but why was it placed outside the power up scroll out? ','?'
'id: 102 ',' Please put an indigo bird into the game. ','?'
'id: 102 ',' Please put an indigo bird!!!! ','?'
'id: 102 ',' And please put an indigo bird! ','?'
'id: 106 ',' On this last update why did u put spanish in there? ','?'
'id: 107 ',' The shockwave bird ad doesn  t even have a close box so you either have to use the *beep* bird or close the game and wait five minutes for it to reset. ','?'
'id: 107 ',' Rovio, please give us a way to play an unadulterated version of Angry Birds!! ','?'
'id: 108 ',' It just make angry bird more fun with the electric shock I can  t wait for a new episode of the game , ','?'
'id: 109 ',' The reason it is only 3 stars is because one time I got so freaken mad on how many freaken times you will fail but all out it is fun and extremely addicting so buy it or else , ','?'
'id: 110 ',' This new update is always crashing. ','?'
'id: 117 ',' I don  t want it, I don  t need it, but it  s in my face and I can  t get rid of it. ','?'
'id: 120 ',' Why does it crash so much i mean really I can  t get into a single level I can  t restore the mighty eagle I can  t do anything with this update so fix it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!? ','?'
'id: 121 ',' The game is really fun but I wish that you could earn coins to buy power ups instead of using real money. ','?'
'id: 136 ',' Please take our concern. ','?'
'id: 138 ',' It crashed on multiple levels. ','?'
'id: 138 ',' I just want a good, normal, fun game that doesn  t lag, crash, or nearly force me to buy ****. ','?'
'id: 144 ',' But I have to rate it 4 stars because you made the menu worse looking. ','?'
'id: 147 ',' Every time I thing this group has gone as far as they can go they have an idea that is neater than the last one. ','?'
'id: 153 ',' Just buy birds and win. ','?'
'id: 159 ',' S. I am happy to see that the daily rewards have returned to Angry Birds Classic, now you just need to bring back the Daily Rewards in Angry Birds Rio. ','?'
'id: 159 ',' As for Angry birds Star Wars II, maybe you could add Daily Rewards for Bird Credits or the "Credit Generator that gives you credits when you complete levels, like in the PC version. ','?'
'id: 159 ',' If not, please update this suggestion. ','?'
'id: 159 ',' Speaking of  which, maybe you could add Bird Credits as Dailly Rewards, earned by completing levels that have beeen completed or not, or in app purchases. ','?'
'id: 159 ',' Those credits could be used to purchase things such as Space eagles, Mighty Millenium Falcons, or Power Ups. ','?'
'id: 191 ',' I have had this game for a long while and never had problems, once I updated my phone to iOS 7, and re downloaded angry birds on an I phone 4 I have not even been able to play the game but rather fight glitches, not full screen and will not respond. ','?'
'id: 193 ',' This game is heavily marketed to kids   fine by me, my kid loves the blankets and bath towels and t shirts   but they  ve added videos to the app you can  t turn off anywhere in the settings. ','?'
'id: 193 ',' He has learning apps that need the network, which makes this app a pain for me. ','?'
'id: 198 ',' I just got the app and every time I try to go on level one, it freezes up and goes off . ','?'
'id: 202 ',' I can  t even play a level with out it crashing. ','?'
'id: 208 ',' I like it but it needs more level updates . ','?'
'id: 209 ',' Whoever decided to make the birds go poof needs to be hailed as a god. ','?'
'id: 211 ',' That &amp; it still randomly crashes. ','?'
'id: 212 ',' The new levels aren  t as fun, and the program crashes regularly on my new iPhone. ','?'
'id: 214 ',' Do not play if you want a life. ','?'
'id: 217 ',' Dude perfect juniors ,  It  s a great game just read some other reviews but sometimes I  ll go to play and it won  t have any progress that I made the last time I played. ','?'
'id: 217 ',' Extremely annoying and so I have not been able to play recently. ','?'
'id: 218 ',' Just bought today and haven  t had a single chance to play, it crashes 24/7. ','?'
'id: 235 ',' This game needs to be better like really oh my gosh like I love lipstick and I put like it on in school like school is cool I get straight as like really do you dress nice I do really you should , ','?'
'id: 250 ',' This literally IS the best game you can get and if you could only have one app, then choose this one , ','?'
'id: 275 ',' \\n\\nHaven  t you milked this enough considering it was ripped off from castle? ','?'
'id: 275 ',' \\n\\nAnd why do you want me to register? ','?'
'id: 280 ',' With all of the updates in iOS and chips since this game was released, honestly, I expected much more from the update to iPhone 5. ','?'
'id: 297 ',' I still play it, just not the latest v. \\n\\nps: please don  t ruin AB Seasons with a similar version. ','?'
'id: 303 ',' Haven  t had any problems with it and it is always entertaining! ','?'
'id: 321 ',' This is almost fun with physics, but the number of levels that require (paid) power ups &amp; perfect aim make it too frustrating to be fun. ','?'
'id: 329 ',' \\n\\nAlso, there are periodically levels added, and they  ve got AB cartoons available in app now. ','?'
'id: 334 ',' I just downloaded the game and now it won  t even launch any of the levels. ','?'
'id: 343 ',' Beaglelova25 ,  I just updated the app and the little blue loading bar thingy on the app itself is stuck on full. ','?'
'id: 343 ',' I can  t open the app, or delete it. ','?'
'id: 343 ',' It has just been sitting on my home screen with a blue bar for about 4 days (I don  t remember when the update came out) and I can  t do anything. ','?'
'id: 344 ',' No, you can  t decline. ','?'
'id: 344 ',' You can close the window, but it will be back next level) I foolishly bought the giant eagle add on (advertised as unlimited use) but now it requires a cool down time. ','?'
'id: 344 ',' Well, I  m sure they need the IAP income. ','?'
'id: 346 ',' We  re all well aware they  re available. ','?'
'id: 350 ',' Quit just changing backgrounds. ','?'
'id: 364 ',' (I use an iPod touch 4g)\\nIf it still works good on the newer devices i recommend this game, and if you have an older ish device i  d steer clear. ','?'
'id: 365 ',' This app crashes all the time especially in the middle of a game! ','?'
'id: 373 ',' Please fix that bug because i really like your Vidios so much and if you do fix it i  Will rate it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 378 ',' Plz add a super hero angry birds and have batman superman and everyone plz mention me in the game if you make it and have green lantern flash all of the justice league and also please have a marvel one too PLZ and yea thx plz read this  Tarik , ','?'
'id: 387 ',' It crashes and it won  t keep your progress between other devices if you are not online. ','?'
'id: 393 ',' So I used to have angry birds before the last two updates But when they updated it all it has is adds and crashes. ','?'
'id: 398 ',' Any way the other one was better and you took away everyone  s favorite levels! ','?'
'id: 402 ',' That would be cool if they did it right , ','?'
'id: 408 ',' So here I am one year later and I want it again. ','?'
'id: 409 ',' But everytime I try to open Red  s Mighty Feather  crash. ','?'
'id: 410 ',' Every single time i try to play it, it crashes , ','?'
'id: 412 ',' The game crashed and deleted all my progress. ','?'
'id: 412 ',' And the new power of the red bird, directional targeting, kinda goes against the appeal of the original game  you fire a bird and can  t change it  s direction. ','?'
'id: 417 ',' Why do you keep messing with a good thing? ','?'
'id: 418 ',' Great upgrade but why is everything written in Japanese? ','?'
'id: 419 ',' Glad they neatened up the mechanic, and added normal levels! ','?'
'id: 424 ',' If u hate it, then you are going to forget it! ','?'
'id: 427 ',' It crashes , ','?'
'id: 432 ',' The game is perfect and I don  t understand why so many people hate what you added in the new update....well personally and honestly I LOVE the new update but is it ok if Rovio adds a new bird? ','?'
'id: 432 ',' How about an owl? ','?'
'id: 432 ',' Surely they could use some help.but if so you people at Rovio did a amazing job with the update.just add an owl! ','?'
'id: 436 ',' DrBisquit ,  Here  s my review for Red  s Mighty (Crappy) Feathers: it  s just not fun. ','?'
'id: 437 ',' Dont get this every time you try to play it goes to the iPod menu. ','?'
'id: 439 ',' And to all those people that plan to quit cuz they dont like these moving targets...just dont play those! ','?'
'id: 441 ',' All the new "updates" have only given me constant lagging and crashing, and I can  t even play Red  s Mighty Feathers. ','?'
'id: 442 ',' Every time I minimize the game during play and then hit the home button to do something else, then open it back up to resume, It crashes and I have to start the game all over again!!!! ','?'
'id: 446 ',' I think you  re just trying to push the "bad piggies" concept too far. ','?'
'id: 450 ',' A fun game if you are looking to kill time. ','?'
'id: 455 ',' I tried to get back into this game but I  m just not becoming a fan of the franchise anymore. ','?'
'id: 457 ',' I love the game but it needs more levels. ','?'
'id: 462 ',' Adding the time component makes this no fun. ','?'
'id: 468 ',' The black birds should have cannons. ','?'
'id: 468 ',' Please make the game rovio. ','?'
'id: 470 ',' Just delete the red feather off the next version. ','?'
'id: 471 ',' I would tell everyone it  s great, play the game and see. ','?'
'id: 473 ',' If you  re looking for a new challenge, I highly recommend this update. ','?'
'id: 481 ',' Games now a day need story to be good, and all of the App Store goes against that saying that "if you want a story you should write a book" you are a bad developer and I hope you go bankrupt, because you are already creatively bankrupt. ','?'
'id: 486 ',' On my iPod Touch 4, the app crashes whenever I try to open the new level. ','?'
'id: 488 ',' Rex  s Mighty Feathers levels are fast paced and require multiple frustrating losses before I can figure out what I  m supposed to be doing in the level I  m on, let alone progress to the next level. ','?'
'id: 489 ',' Is there anyone that can tell me why I can have a whole world completed, but the next random time I decide to play and the game loads up, it deletes all my progress as if I never played the levels I actually completed. ','?'
'id: 495 ',' Rovio, you just made a new level be crap. ','?'
'id: 503 ',' As others said, interesting concept but the lack of birds to use, response time, and targeting system create a very unpleasant gaming experience. ','?'
'id: 504 ',' I can  t beat lvl 23 on surf and turf. ','?'
'id: 508 ',' \\n\\nI don  t get why you have to put ads for your own games and when I don  t beat a level you prompt me to use a powerup. ','?'
'id: 509 ',' Even though I  m only on the 5th episode I can tell Red  s Mighty Feather  s is gonna be AWESOME!!! ','?'
'id: 510 ',' I thought thats what they created all the various spin offs you had to buy for. ','?'
'id: 510 ',' I don  t even believe it deserves the one star I had to give it to post this review. ','?'
'id: 517 ',' As soon as I get to the level selection the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 518 ',' On F 15, you have to wait three seconds to even try a restart while you watch the pig fly. ','?'
'id: 521 ',' Please remove it from the game. ','?'
'id: 530 ',' I updated this app. ','?'
'id: 531 ',' So not only has Rovio failed to provide any challenges, but they seem to feel the need to pimp their power ups ever few levels, it  s like receiving spam as a reward for every couple of minutes you play, for this reason alone I will not buy another Rovio game! ','?'
'id: 540 ',' I hate this update I wish they didn  t even make this update its so stupid and boring ruined the whole game. ','?'
'id: 541 ',' Just so you know rovio I love the new levels theyer a great idea , ','?'
'id: 545 ',' I think it would be cool if you added a level creator where you could make levels and share them with friends. ','?'
'id: 548 ',' While I am playing the game I want to go to a different board and when I tap on one it will close me out of the app completely and I will try to do it again and the same thing will happen. ','?'
'id: 551 ',' So please take my advise Rovio. ','?'
'id: 555 ',' That  s the last time I will update. ','?'
'id: 557 ',' On the right path but, you need to include "all" angry bird types and increase the difficulty. ','?'
'id: 558 ',' I just downloaded the new update and every time i try to play a level it crashes. ','?'
'id: 559 ',' what happened to the music? ','?'
'id: 561 ',' DRodriguez89 ,  Never mind the endlessly infuriating new levels or the cacophonous new intro music that sounds like it was composed by someone trying to mock carnivals...how can Rovio calls this an update at all? ','?'
'id: 567 ',' It crashes when I click on a level , ','?'
'id: 569 ',' I can only hope you will try to redeem yourself by staying true to what angry birds was originally about. ','?'
'id: 570 ',' I agree this would be good as a separate game but maybe try to stick to the normal layout for this game? ','?'
'id: 570 ',' They would tell you a change this abrupt would not be effective and would in fact lose some of your fanbase. ','?'
'id: 572 ',' It is super frustrating because the aim is off. ','?'
'id: 577 ',' But, that is what they made the other Angry Birds Games for! ','?'
'id: 577 ',' What they should have done, was create a whole different game for these new kinds of gameplay. ','?'
'id: 577 ',' Why try to change it, if it didn  t need to be changed to begin with? ','?'
'id: 581 ',' Please go back to the original AB!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 584 ',' Instead of wasting money on new levels just get a new game. ','?'
'id: 584 ',' But since this is only an opinion i would truly suggest with whatever you feel like since it is your $0.99 , ','?'
'id: 586 ',' Sure, it  s different from the previous levels, but it  s unique and could get a bit challenging if you play the whole thing instead of just playing two levels and saying it  s horrible. ','?'
'id: 586 ',' I  m sure there will be more levels of the same classic Angry Birds coming soon, so all the complainers need to take a seat and be patient. ','?'
'id: 599 ',' The new levels aren  t fun and now I don  t even get daily power ups for the other levels, I wish I never updated the game :( :( :( :( , ','?'
'id: 605 ',' It crashes every time I go into a level and I just can  t play it so I know that  s probably my iPod 4s fault, but ehhhh, it  s great. ','?'
'id: 608 ',' Game crashes every time I try to open it. ','?'
'id: 609 ',' Please, no more updates like this. ','?'
'id: 610 ',' just read your reviews ALL one star with nothing but complaints. ','?'
'id: 615 ',' The mechanics are completely different, the strategy/problem solving aspect is totally gone, and if your shot is so much as a pixel off from what the developers apparently intended, you essentially fail and have to restart the level. ','?'
'id: 625 ',' \\n\\nIt could be improved with some fixes, an letting the player have a fair shake. ','?'
'id: 629 ',' Game crashes. ','?'
'id: 630 ',' I can  t even play it because it crashes when I open it up. ','?'
'id: 630 ',' I see your logo and the Angry Birds picture then it crashes. ','?'
'id: 636 ',' App crashes about every other board I play and have to restart the whole app. ','?'
'id: 640 ',' With the new upgrade that added the new level I am no longer getting the daily power up ( I think that  s what the are called) birds. ','?'
'id: 641 ',' Devon101010 ,  It doesn  t even load and only crashes. ','?'
'id: 644 ',' Every time I try to play the new episode it always crashes but never the other episodes , ','?'
'id: 646 ',' Can you add something to make it easier? ','?'
'id: 647 ',' After years and fun hours playing all the versions of Angry Birds I just deleted the original. ','?'
'id: 647 ',' Adding a "version" of Bad Piggies to the classic Angry Birds was a stupid move. ','?'
'id: 648 ',' I am a huge Angry Bird fan, and was from the beginning but the new update is not what I expected. ','?'
'id: 648 ',' It often crashes too I hate it. ','?'
'id: 648 ',' I  m sorry to say this but Rovio, u just lost a huge angrybirds fan. ','?'
'id: 649 ',' As a certified Angry Birds fanatic I can tell you that this latest update completely misses the mark. ','?'
'id: 649 ',' Apparently product management at Rovio decided that it would be a good idea to completely change everything about the game that has made it a global smash global hit. ','?'
'id: 649 ',' Starting with the slow ramp up of every level where you have to wait a painful amount of time for the piggies to approach the slingshot to the moving targets and poor aiming abilities of the bird. ','?'
'id: 649 ',' \\nHint: It might be a good idea to perform actual user testing with real life customers before changing the core value proposition and nature of the world  s most successful multitouch game. ','?'
'id: 653 ',' \\n\\nPlease, please, please go back to the simple, FUN gameplay that made Angry Birds such a joy to play. ','?'
'id: 654 ',' I  ll gladly take my money back since the developers should be fired and a new crew hired! ','?'
'id: 655 ',' Do NOT download this game because Rovio has ruined the game that we  ve come to love, and if you have the game, don  t update it! ','?'
'id: 655 ',' Rovio needs to fix the game and get rid of the new levels, or else they  re going to lose a lot of fans and the franchise is going to fail! ','?'
'id: 656 ',' My game crashes on the new levels but lets me play all the other ones , ','?'
'id: 658 ',' Maybe Rovio  s planning to make a game with that gameplay and is testing the waters to see if people like it. ','?'
'id: 661 ',' The new update has a huge bug that causes some of the missions to have the targeting locked on a certain point no matter where you press. ','?'
'id: 662 ',' I needed to report a bug. ','?'
'id: 663 ',' I love the new Reds Mighty Feathers but for some reason, ever since I updated it, the classic Angry Birds isn  t giving me my Daily Reward anymore. ','?'
'id: 663 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 668 ',' I just hit the mighty eagle by mistake. ','?'
'id: 668 ',' Since there  s a "waiting period" before you can use it again, I would have preferred to use it on a different level. ','?'
'id: 668 ',' If there was a way to automatically "gray" them out once you release the bird, I would give it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 671 ',' Whenever I click a level on my iPod touch, it crashes automatically. ','?'
'id: 675 ',' I confirmed to update this game 5 days ago. ','?'
'id: 675 ',' Has just barely started installation. ','?'
'id: 679 ',' Ever since i got the update every time i click a level the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 702 ',' Game was fun till the ads I was planning on buying their other games but not so sure now , ','?'
'id: 703 ',' The pigs start moving towards the egg, and you just have to start shooting. ','?'
'id: 703 ',' Don  t think, don  t strategize, just start shooting and hope you win. ','?'
'id: 707 ',' Whoever is in charge of adding new levels should be fired. ','?'
'id: 708 ',' I  m still giving angry birds 3 stars, since my little brother loves this game so much, but please do better next time. ','?'
'id: 709 ',' New level lacks what made everyone love Angry Birds in the first place, and seems to be designed for toddlers. ','?'
'id: 709 ',' Just make traditional levels for angry birds and angry birds seasons. ','?'
'id: 712 ',' Please undo last update. ','?'
'id: 713 ',' Then I made the mistake of thinking that uninstalling and then reinstalling the app might help. ','?'
'id: 713 ',' Please, please fix these bugs. ','?'
'id: 714 ',' For whatever reason it has been crashing when I try to go to a different level. ','?'
'id: 718 ',' But where is the precision and attention to responsiveness? ','?'
'id: 721 ',' This should have been introduced as an entirely new (but still crappy) game, rather than as a new "level" with no resemblance to the original formula. ','?'
'id: 725 ',' This level needs to be scratched. ','?'
'id: 726 ',' \\n\\nThe person that made this call should be fired!!!! ','?'
'id: 726 ',' Please take this crap level off of the game and give us more regular Angry Bird levels. ','?'
'id: 730 ',' Please change it to the older music or I  ll delete it! ','?'
'id: 734 ',' \\n\\nAB is not an action game, and the whole idea of racing against a clock is counter to what made the strategy of flinging birds so much fun. ','?'
'id: 737 ',' Please do something to make it more interesting, or stop designing these ridiculous new levels. ','?'
'id: 738 ',' The much bigger problem is that after I downloaded the app, my iPhone 5 began to overheat in my pocket. ','?'
'id: 739 ',' The new update combines all the not fun of Bad Piggies with illogical, frustrating gameplay and the ruination of everything that made the game fun. ','?'
'id: 739 ',' Thank  Zeus for A.B. Star Wars &amp; A.G. Space because this just cuts the b**ls off everything that made the game a global phenom. ','?'
'id: 742 ',' Why change a good thing? ','?'
'id: 744 ',' Every time I try to open it, it crashes. ','?'
'id: 753 ',' Rovio took a risk by adding something fresh and different and it works great. ','?'
'id: 754 ',' The new levels are fun and for me quite challenging I checked angry birds nest and it appears that you are also adding classics but bad piggis needs more golden eggs but despite that I  m looking forward to classic update\\n\\n  From the pigges , ','?'
'id: 757 ',' I think the new idea for reds angry feather is great! ','?'
'id: 760 ',' I can  t believe Rovio went to all this trouble to turn a perfectly fun and addicting game into a game that should just be thrown in the trash!!! ','?'
'id: 766 ',' Whenever I try to play the new levels, the app just crashes. ','?'
'id: 769 ',' It crashes onto iPod 4th gen it won  t even let me go to the gameplay , ','?'
'id: 770 ',' Just shoot same bird over and over again. ','?'
'id: 770 ',' They always fail. ','?'
'id: 771 ',' I don  t like Bad Piggies and I don  t like Rovio ruining Angry Birds by adding BP elements. ','?'
'id: 773 ',' Works ok with iPhone 4 and IOS6, but now crashes EVERY TIME on 1st Gen iPad running IOS5.1, so, as I said . . . , ','?'
'id: 774 ',' It took me a while to figure out how to play the new update. ','?'
'id: 774 ',' Please add new birds. ','?'
'id: 774 ',' Please lose all of your ads! ','?'
'id: 775 ',' Please help on the new update every time I try and go on birds of a feather it keeps taking me out. ','?'
'id: 776 ',' \\n\\nRovio I must ask: why did you diverge from the original Angry Birds games? ','?'
'id: 776 ',' Just give me some birds, a slingshot, pigs to aim at, some gravity, a few things to knock down and I  m happy. ','?'
'id: 776 ',' \\n\\nThat said, please listen to what your customers are telling you. ','?'
'id: 776 ',' If we say we want the original format, that  s what you should stick with. ','?'
'id: 780 ',' The new update takes the worst, most uninteresting bird in the game and makes it the only bird available. ','?'
'id: 780 ',' Add to that the unobtainable three star rating system where you have to complete the level using less than 10 12 birds but it takes 30 40 to complete each level due to only having use of the lamest bird in the bunch and what is essentially a timer on each level. ','?'
'id: 784 ',' Stick with the elements of the game that made it a success to begin with! ','?'
'id: 788 ',' But the latest level just takes this game to a new level of low. ','?'
'id: 788 ',' \\n\\nHonestly, was this designed for a group of semi literate morons who need to be hand held through the game? ','?'
'id: 788 ',' There is no excitement here. ','?'
'id: 791 ',' When I tried playing the new level, it crashed! ','?'

'id: 803 ',' Sorry Rovio     this new level just doesn  t do it for me. ','?'
'id: 805 ',' I don  t get it you just have to tap and it does the work for you. ','?'
'id: 806 ',' You  ll lose interest and soon delete it, just as I have done. ','?'

'id: 824 ',' I just want to thank those who didn  t like the latest update and posted their reviews. ','?'
'id: 825 ',' We  ve been tapping where the birds go since day one, why is it locked to the pigs in the new levels? ','?'
'id: 832 ',' Rovio, why do you still try to make bad piggies happen ?? ','?'
'id: 837 ',' It wasn  t broken til you tried to fix it. ','?'
'id: 839 ',' ive been playing and enjoyed angry birds since the beginning but levels like the ones released in the newest update just turn me away. ','?'
'id: 842 ',' cant play new levels when i open it crashes please fix , ','?'
'id: 843 ',' They are very boring and require little strategy. ','?'
'id: 844 ',' It crashes every time I load one level. ','?'
'id: 845 ',' I  ve had the Angry Birds app for 2 3 years now, but this update is so bad, I got frustrated and just deleted the entire app. ','?'
'id: 848 ',' Rococo always updates all their games with new levels, which is great, they update more than any other app or series of apps I know. ','?'
'id: 848 ',' For those of you that don  t like it, you  ve got 4 other angry birds games where you just launch birds at pigs if that  s what you enjoy. ','?'
'id: 857 ',' Do not like this new version. ','?'
'id: 857 ',' What happened to the angry birds I have loved? ','?'
'id: 861 ',' Shoulda made it a new game, I loved the game until the new levels. ','?'
'id: 862 ',' It just kicks me out of the game , ','?'
'id: 866 ',' But I can  t resize the screen like I could on the previous versions. ','?'
'id: 869 ',' Please give us a normal update, or even a slightly different version like the last AB Seasons update. ','?'
'id: 872 ',' When I try to open a Red  s Mighty Feathers level, the game crashes! ','?'
'id: 874 ',' The new levels introduce twitch play, where you have to do things quickly and just at just the right time/way to win. ','?'

'id: 875 ',' Each time I try to play the newest levels on my iPod Touch it crashes. ','?'
'id: 878 ',' When play the first level it crashes!!!! ','?'
'id: 880 ',' New game play is horrible and stripped of all the elements that made angry birds fun. ','?'
'id: 882 ',' I used to love angry birds but after the new update whenever I try to play the new level the app stops altogether but it works fine for the rest of the levels rovio better fix this soon , ','?'
'id: 888 ',' I can  t play the new part since it keeps crashing on me, please fix it , ','?'
'id: 891 ',' Why isn  t it different on the App Store? ','?'
'id: 894 ',' I love angry birds, this update just needs bug fixes. ','?'
'id: 894 ',' It crashed when I tried playing a level. ','?'
'id: 900 ',' Can  t play because it crashes constantly! ','?'
'id: 904 ',' These new levels are insane, they need improvements so that we can actually aim at other stuff instead of just the pig, it  s rigged , ','?'
'id: 905 ',' Heath Aston ,  It  s not working for my iPod fourth gen. It doesn  t even let me get to the actual gameplay , ','?'
'id: 912 ',' I need episodes like birdday party or danger above , ','?'
'id: 921 ',' Whoever created the newest levels should be reevaluated because they are absolute garbage , ','?'
'id: 923 ',' When you update this app, installing sequence is frozen. ','?'
'id: 931 ',' This is the best game I have ever played but I think you should make something where you can make your own levels. ','?'
'id: 931 ',' That would make this game a lot more fun because once you complete the game there are more levels that you can play that aren  t part of the campaign. ','?'
'id: 933 ',' It so much a junk kids should love to learn they shouldn  t be on there iPod iPad or whatever all day they need to learn to get a life , ','?'
'id: 934 ',' Sure the AB Toons are great, but Rovio needs to let people turn off cellular data usage as a setting. ','?'
'id: 935 ',' Sometimes whenever I play Angry Birds, I can  t stand with losing cause it can be hard sometimes cause the green pigs can be hard to get. ','?'
'id: 937 ',' Please make the toons not need Wi Fi. ','?'
'id: 941 ',' I am very satisfied with every Angry Birds game \\nAnd if I could add more stars I would\\n\\n555,555,555,555,555,555,555,555,555,555,555 stars for me , ','?'
'id: 950 ',' And even after paying real life money to unlock the eagle, you can only use it every so often. ','?'
'id: 954 ',' Please add the dotted path again. ','?'
'id: 955 ',' I can get a BETTER game then this any day I don  t understand why angry birds is so popular it  s sooo simple and BORING I had this app for two days and took it off? ','?'
'id: 955 ',' There just making a bunch of money off this game t shirts stuffed animals...you would think it was the best thing in the AppStore! ','?'
'id: 957 ',' But it would be better if you made angry birds 2!!!! ','?'
'id: 959 ',' This game is worth the conspipated crap that just exited my butthole , ','?'
'id: 972 ',' Please change the notification sound to default. ','?'
'id: 972 ',' I just received a notification message with a sound that sounded like a crazy person laughing. ','?'

'id: 985 ',' The fans made it #1, not Apple. ','?'
'id: 995 ',' My phone crashed and when I reinstalled everything, I no longer had the Mighty Eagle which I had already purchased. ','?'
'id: 999 ',' But now every time I go to this app it automatically goes home, so now I can  t even play. ','?'
'id: 1001 ',' I love angry birds but it needs more levels with the big red bird and the pink bird!!!!!!!! ','?'

'id: 1012 ',' You guys need to fix this!! ','?'
'id: 1025 ',' I used to love this app but when ever I try to do anything it crashes and won  t let me open it again , ','?'
'id: 1027 ',' Angry Birds is a great game and if they made a jurassic park one I would buy it right away! ','?'
'id: 1040 ',' I don  t have a good sense of what actually kills the pigs, versus just wounding them, and any results I get don  t seem at all repeatable from one attempt to the next. ','?'
'id: 1040 ',' As a result, failures are frustrating because the controls fight my attempts at precision, and successes are unsatisfying because it feels like I just caught a lucky break. ','?'
'id: 1040 ',' But I just don  t get it. ','?'
'id: 1046 ',' I am ready to delete the game b/c I can  t stand getting these text msgs. ','?'
'id: 1054 ',' Can  t believe I just noticed it. ','?'
'id: 1057 ',' It is difficult to know how to start. ','?'
'id: 1057 ',' If you see a large "play" button in the middle of a screen, you would assume it starts the game, but no, it just brings you to another screen to try to sell more games. ','?'
'id: 1067 ',' Only problem is icons on upper left of screen get in the way and hide the bird. ','?'
'id: 1067 ',' It may be disabled but still shows gray icon. ','?'
'id: 1071 ',' Rovio frequently updates the game with more content/levels. ','?'
'id: 1076 ',' The star rating thing today is plain boring I would like to see the star rating music again , ','?'
'id: 1078 ',' Please make an update that will not crash the app. ','?'
'id: 1085 ',' Ive even tried deleting it and downloadin again but but dont do no good! ','?'
'id: 1087 ',' However, the physics system is completely inconsistent  doing the exact same thing over and over will give you different results every time, which means you can  t be "good" at this game, only lucky. ','?'
'id: 1106 ',' The best app to have when you are mad just fling the black bird and blow up a pig or six I goten two free sofar this one and rio. ','?'
'id: 1113 ',' I  ve play the game before and I just now downloaded it for free but it keeps crashing on the first level. ','?'
'id: 1116 ',' Angry Birds used to only take up about 20 MB  of space on my disc now its eating up a whopping 176 MB of space is there anyway possible that an update could reduce the scale of this game ? ','?'
'id: 1118 ',' Every time I open it, and the first level begins to load, the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 1119 ',' I hate how you have to wait for it to load up before you can play. ','?'
'id: 1125 ',' I  ve talked to others who have had the same issue. ','?'
'id: 1129 ',' I love this game but now with the new update or levels or something it crashes &amp; goes slow at times..please fix , ','?'

'id: 1191 ',' I like it but each time I try out onevif the first levels it crashes , ','?'
'id: 1197 ',' Im just wondering :why the f   is this so popular?? ','?'
'id: 1212 ',' You should provide the way to get all achievement or just increase app price (include Unlimited use of Mighty Eagle) so true gamer should know how they should pay if they want to complete game challenger at 100%. ','?'
'id: 1212 ',' Create a great game, then made you down a bad company. ','?'
'id: 1216 ',' On a level i cant beat whenever im about to win it lags on me and i fail , ','?'

'id: 1281 ',' To get 3 stars, you need to spend money. ','?'
'id: 1283 ',' When I go to the 1st level, it crashes. ','?'
'id: 1287 ',' The fact that is now available for free, just without words. ','?'
'id: 1307 ',' Thanks for the app please keep new updates coming. ','?'
'id: 1312 ',' Please remove your company logo off the app icon Rovio! ','?'
'id: 1316 ',' why somebody didnt see this like a good game for relax? ','?'
'id: 1320 ',' Just updated to version 3.1.0 &amp; completely lost all progress. ','?'
'id: 1322 ',' Worthless when the app crashes every time on 22 2 , ','?'
'id: 1328 ',' This game is awesome especially how it is free and all the new features they have added are very good. ','?'
'id: 1333 ',' What happened to the one you have to pay , ','?'
'id: 1342 ',' I want to stab the pigs when they grin after you fail a map. ','?'
'id: 1353 ',' I can  t get passed the first level because it crashes , ','?'
'id: 1354 ',' Game crashes every time in the new update :/ , ','?'
'id: 1357 ',' It crashes when i start the first level ','?'
'id: 1360 ',' I just redownloaded it after not having it for a while. ','?'
'id: 1360 ',' Just out of principle I  m thinkin of deleting the game. ','?'
'id: 1360 ',' Please take that junk off of the otherwise beautiful icon that we love. ','?'
'id: 1378 ',' It starts off slowly, as you just throw red birds, after they introduce more birds, (around level 15) the game becomes more strategic. ','?'
'id: 1383 ',' It crashes as soon as  i get to load the level , ','?'
'id: 1384 ',' I just got a new iPod and when I tried to  download the mighty eagle it wouldn  t let me. ','?'
'id: 1386 ',' Dear Rovio, please remove your company logo from the previously beautiful Angry Birds logo. ','?'
'id: 1388 ',' Players can create their own levels and submit them  via Internet on a mobile device or computer. ','?'
'id: 1393 ',' \\nAll you have to do is:\\n Go to FeaturePoints(dot)com\\n Enter FIY2UE into the Referral Box (You gain extra points)\\n Download Free apps or refer friends\\n Get Free Points\\n Get your Free iTunes Card! ','?'
'id: 1394 ',' Great game but you need to put create your own levels in the next update , ','?'
'id: 1402 ',' No new levels added for months now. ','?'
'id: 1416 ',' Why can  t it look like it did when it first came out? ','?'
'id: 1416 ',' Please bring back that look we had in version 1.5.2 in the next update. ','?'
'id: 1417 ',' I just realized that you had to update it! ','?'
'id: 1419 ',' The way it  s set up is amazing. ','?'
'id: 1421 ',' My game crashes at the logo screen. ','?'
'id: 1423 ',' By far an overall awesome app but it needs an update , ','?'
'id: 1424 ',' I am not a fan of frequently accidentally hitting the adds and being taken out of the game, to safari and then to the app store just because I paused the game to restart a level. ','?'
'id: 1434 ',' It provides months of short, 5 10 minute, entertainment. ','?'
'id: 1434 ',' When you are bored, having trouble sleeping, waiting at the dentist, or just need a break, this games provides a moment of entertainment. ','?'
'id: 1434 ',' It has loads of levels and layers and provides a challenge for every style of gaming. ','?'
'id: 1435 ',' But I agree with TuckTuck, a level builder would be cool, also we need some new birds too! ','?'
'id: 1435 ',' Please consider!! ','?'
'id: 1445 ',' Please pass this on to Rovio and maybe they  ll consider it in future games! ','?'
'id: 1451 ',' You guys should try to make more levels, where while the birds are at the beach the pigs go under water with the eggs, or maybe they would hide in a whale. ','?'
'id: 1468 ',' Why do you need Open GL 2.0? ','?'
'id: 1468 ',' Please fix that. ','?'
'id: 1470 ',' Go to the App Store and get the first AB game you can find then ask a friend how to play. ','?'
'id: 1486 ',' I got a new phone and the stars didn  t go to the new one I am mad please make it where you can keep the distance in the game. ','?'
'id: 1489 ',' Please fix issue for iPhone   every time I  m playing the game and a phone alarm, incoming call, text, etc pops up (which I hit the snooze or ok button) the sound then goes off the game and the only way to fix it is to reboot phone). ','?'
'id: 1490 ',' My only complaint is that some stages can be exceedingly difficult but still one of the best iOS games available! ','?'
'id: 1497 ',' I absolutely love angry birds but sometimes there r levels I can  t beat very fast and it ends up taking forever. ','?'
'id: 1498 ',' \\n\\nThere is 1 bug that I  ve seen: sometimes when ur phone is switched to silent, and u turn silent off, the sound does not come on regardless of the sound settings in the app. ','?'
'id: 1498 ',' I don  t know exactly how to reproduce the bug, but when i have the problem it is something like: use the app when the phone is on silent, leave the app for an extended period of time (24 or more hours), then return to the app, then flip your phone off silent, and there is no sound. ','?'
'id: 1498 ',' My iPhone 4 running iOS 6.0.1 had the same problem. ','?'
'id: 1501 ',' I just recently got an iPhone and immediately downloaded angry birds from my iTunes account to keep playing. ','?'
'id: 1505 ',' Recently, every time I open the app it loads for about thirty seconds, and then it just crashes. ','?'
'id: 1505 ',' I bet it  s just a bug. ','?'
'id: 1505 ',' I would love if you saw this review and tried to update the app so it doesn  t crash anymore. ','?'
'id: 1515 ',' I feel if you have an iPhone and you buy the mighty eagle then you get a iPad or iPod and download this game on them, since you can do it for free I feel if you already bought the eagle that should be included for free as well. ','?'
'id: 1524 ',' If you are ever stuck on a level, just buy the big bird once for a dollar and use it on as many levels you want! ','?'
'id: 1525 ',' No new updates come on ever since angry birds Star Wars came there were no new updates wars next there going to make an angry birds ninja for them and roivio how  s that for an idea or angry birds Greek gods choose so I can have fun with my iPod touch 4g just choose the ideas that I told u ok and stay cool plz I love u guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 1528 ',' Why are pigs stealing eggs? ','?'
'id: 1528 ',' Why are they green? ','?'

'id: 1537 ',' and why would you want the same game on more then one of your iPod, iPad, iPhone? ','?'
'id: 1540 ',' I have a factory refurbished older iPad and it cannot run IOS 7. ','?'

'id: 1552 ',' Why keep on asking when I already said no? ','?'
'id: 1552 ',' Second, why not use background update feature of ios7 to do it, rather than the awkward location based method? ','?'
'id: 1553 ',' It wont even let me change tabs, then crashes. ','?'

'id: 1559 ',' Why are you following Apple  s lead with the crappy, dull, uninspired look? ','?'
'id: 1562 ',' Ever since iOS 7 update, Dropbox has not worked; constantly crashes, when it does run it is EXTREMELY slow, and there are problems with camera uploading. ','?'

'id: 1565 ',' Why I can  t I upload photos from my camera roll one at a time instead of the entire camera roll? ','?'
'id: 1565 ',' Please change this. ','?'
'id: 1567 ',' I even set up a different box to try and fix it thinking my original box was the problem. ','?'

'id: 1582 ',' JohnInThisLife ,  Why did you drop support for earlier IOSs? ','?'
'id: 1585 ',' Why no backward compatibility to iOS 6? ','?'
'id: 1585 ',' I think it is a huge mistake to do so. ','?'
'id: 1585 ',' I have been a Dropbox user for years and, unfortunately, must look for another solution unless an iOS 6 version is made available again. ','?'
'id: 1586 ',' This app needs to support older OS versions! ','?'
'id: 1588 ',' Similarly every single app that gets updated to a "beautiful" ios7 look is one I will not update. ','?'
'id: 1591 ',' This should Really be fixed! ','?'
'id: 1591 ',' And you still can  t upload videos!! ','?'
'id: 1594 ',' Is it just me, or is anyone else having the problem where the app won  t even open at all? ','?'
'id: 1594 ',' I need to save my photos. ','?'
'id: 1615 ',' I  ve never had any issues with it and have been a user for years. ','?'
'id: 1619 ',' The app doesn  t work unless you have the iOS 7 update and not all devices have that update so they should really fix this. ','?'
'id: 1621 ',' I now see that you must have IO7 or better for the app. ','?'
'id: 1624 ',' Please, please give us the ability to rename files from this app. ','?'
'id: 1629 ',' I  ll rate 5 once you can view ". ','?'
'id: 1633 ',' I still cannot believe that the team at Dropbox STILL hasn? ','?'
'id: 1635 ',' Sez needs software update but Apple sez software is uptodate. ','?'
'id: 1637 ',' It would allow me to get work done on my phone and edit files on the go for projects. ','?'

'id: 1646 ',' The pictures show a white background just like the iOS7 photo app. ','?'
'id: 1651 ',' U Dropbox employers improved mostly everything, but in the app it should have the ability to rename files, whereas the web version can. ','?'
'id: 1653 ',' Ask me if I would like to use background uploading only once and remember my preference   don  t pester me every time I open the app to turn that feature on. ','?'
'id: 1654 ',' My only issue is that it still is taking FOREVER to upload videos I recorded. ','?'
'id: 1654 ',' And all the time that it is uploading I have to keep tapping to keep my iPad awake (because there is no "Do Not Go To Sleep" setting for this app) AND you have to keep it in Dropbox because it cannot upload in the background. ','?'
'id: 1654 ',' I love this app, just wish it had a few more setting options or resolved the uploading video issue. ','?'
'id: 1660 ',' How can we use it? ','?'
'id: 1661 ',' Not sure why it would not allow this function? ','?'
'id: 1661 ',' If I can  t use the documents in drop box on my iPad in a useful way then what  s the point in being able to access them? ','?'

'id: 2341 ',' jh7468 ,  I have no idea why you need Location Services activated, but it  s just one of the hassles of this app. ','?'
'id: 2341 ',' The biggest hassle is that you either have to transfer ALL your pictures to your DB folder, or you can  t transfer any. ','?'

'id: 2365 ',' As far as the app goes, however, there are a few bugs that need to be worked out and some features that ought to be added. ','?'
'id: 2365 ',' The app will often time fail to open a document and needs to be restarted before it will load. ','?'
'id: 2365 ',' It will sometimes even freeze and crash. ','?'
'id: 2365 ',' In order to open your files on a mobile device, you have to be connected to the internet. ','?'

'id: 2390 ',' Haven  t had any problems with the function of the app, no crashes either. ','?'

'id: 2447 ',' Little disappointed I can  t edit docs from within the app such as google drive. ','?'
'id: 2448 ',' It opens *maybe* once a week and when it does, it repeatedly re syncs already uploaded pics....so it gets stuck around photo 1,225 (approximately), crashes and won  t open. ','?'

'id: 2534 ',' \\nI also created a folder, put a bunch of photos in it, and they were there at first, but after a few minutes the folder was empty. ','?'
'id: 2534 ',' I could not figure out how to do it. ','?'
'id: 2534 ',' And the instructions included in the app on how to use Dropbox were written for a standard computer, NOT on iOS device. ','?'
'id: 2535 ',' There was no way to stop them, and after failed attempts to stop the uploads but before I deleted the app the uploads had racked up 96 MB of data in just 10 minutes. ','?'
'id: 2535 ',' But I can tell you that I will be using Google Drive primarily, but not exclusively, both on my computer and on my phone until this problem is fixed. ','?'
'id: 2535 ',' Being able to cancel file downloads and uploads is CRUCIAL to all applications that exchange data in mass, and Dropbox should be expected to be able to cancel uploads. ','?'
'id: 2536 ',' Why should I keep using Dropbox when it can  t even open a PDF? ','?'
'id: 2543 ',' Simple, just what I needed to make transferring certain photos from phone to computer and vice versa simple. ','?'

'id: 2585 ',' But why the hel should I must turn on location service for downloading a photo from my uploads? ','?'

'id: 2837 ',' The only way I have found to clear this memory is to uninstall the app every time it balloons, which, as you can probably guess, is extremely annoying. ','?'
'id: 2837 ',' If someone can tell me an easier way to clear this space or if Dropbox can fix this issue, this would be a five star app for me. ','?'
'id: 2840 ',' This service, and this app, would be great if the app didn  t crash when reading PDFs. ','?'

'id: 4107 ',' Brandonfave ,  I can  t rename notes. ','?'
'id: 4107 ',' This is a SERIOUS issue! ','?'
'id: 4111 ',' I just bought my first Mac (a MacBook Pro) and added Evernote right away based on friends   recommendations. ','?'
'id: 4111 ',' But when I added it to my iPad so the two devices could sync etc. it completely screwed up my iPad so that the device often freezes or Safari suddenly shuts down. ','?'
'id: 4111 ',' Since Evernote is the only change I  ve made to my iPad in a year I can  t think what else could be causing this so I just uninstalled Evernote. ','?'
'id: 4119 ',' But I  m changing my previous 5 star rating to 1 star because the app crashes every time it tries to sync my Evernote account on iPhone 5s. ','?'
'id: 4126 ',' I just up updated my ipad to ios 7, as well as, installed this newer update for Evernote. ','?'
'id: 4126 ',' I would love to have the bugs fixed asap. ','?'
'id: 4126 ',' I upgraded to Premium because my lessons require detailed planning, photos, videos. ','?'
'id: 4126 ',' Many times I find amazing supplemental activities for my students and time fails me to achieve those goals. ','?'
'id: 4126 ',' I am awaiting an update and hoping you  ll consider my suggestions. ','?'
'id: 4127 ',' Why hasn  t the team added tables or the ability to do more font manipulation from the mobile apps. ','?'
'id: 4141 ',' Evernote is such a great idea, but it is constantly getting in my way of dealing with notes as I see fit. ','?'
'id: 4141 ',' I can  t move notes from one notebook to another in the iOS versions. ','?'
'id: 4141 ',' Please fix this, I  m canceling my premium subscription until this gets fixed. ','?'
'id: 4142 ',' Very frustrating and this makes it so the two step verification does not work! ','?'
'id: 4143 ',' \\n\\nI suggest the following. ','?'
'id: 4143 ',' \\n\\nThis is an interface bug. ','?'
'id: 4143 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 4145 ',' I just deleted an entire document when I meant to copy. ','?'
'id: 4148 ',' Please fix this as otherwise it is a great app! ','?'
'id: 4150 ',' I love and depend upon Evernote and the last update seemed to fix everything on the iPhone but still runs slow on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 4152 ',' Sometimes it crashes, or I can not open some files with it. ','?'
'id: 4153 ',' Just spend the time to learn it in the beginning, set up the shortcuts, and enjoy. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' But today it crashed and lost all my data about 20 minutes into a meeting. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' With the quality I experienced with this product in the past I can  t believe they would release their software in this condition. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' \\n\\n** UPDATE 10/20/2011**\\nMany of the bugs have been fixed and the app is looking very good. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' However there is still a bug that causes a lot of crashing. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' If you touch and hold in an attempt to position the cursor the application crashes hard. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' Luckily my data wasn  t lost like last time but in a meeting where time can sometimes be short I don  t need to be restarting my software. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' It crashed when I attempted to select a recipient  s email address from Exchange. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' It would only use my default account and I wanted to use my business account. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' Finally I needed to copy my notes out so I could email using the correct account and I noticed that "copy" doesn  t work on the review screen. ','?'
'id: 4157 ',' There is still one bug when trying to move the cursor around. ','?'
'id: 4160 ',' Evernote keeps on adding new features but many old bugs are present while adding new ones. ','?'
'id: 4163 ',' Either way I  m dam glad to have consistency again, my memory is bad enough without it. ','?'
'id: 4166 ',' Highly recommend this app for everything. ','?'
'id: 4170 ',' Didn  t have this issue before upgrading to iOS 7 , ','?'
'id: 4171 ',' But I would like to have the availability to modify size and color of a word or whole sentence in a paragraph. ','?'
'id: 4172 ',' \\nFunctionality and sharing is great, but needs a facelift for sure. ','?'
'id: 4174 ',' This was a great app that now crashes every other day and requires a re install. ','?'
'id: 4177 ',' Or maybe that should be stated in the past tense. ','?'
'id: 4177 ',' \\n\\nIt simply does not work anymore. ','?'
'id: 4178 ',' the iphone app, even on my brand new &amp; fully updated iphone, crashes almost every day at least once. ','?'
'id: 4183 ',' Shame I now have to mirror all my important lists in the simplenote app\\n\\n Will update review to five stars again once iOS these bugs have been fixed. ','?'
'id: 4185 ',' But they shouldn  t make you pay to view your notes when you have no Internet connection. ','?'
'id: 4186 ',' Where are my other notes? ','?'
'id: 4187 ',' Bugs from 7.0 are still in 7.1.1 yet they had time to add new, and useless, functionality. ','?'
'id: 4191 ',' Unfortunately, I have to write my complaint here, because the app is so buggy, it continues to tell me that "there was an error submitting your ticket. ','?'
'id: 4191 ',' Please fix the mobile apps, or I fear you  ll lose more than just me. ','?'
'id: 4192 ',' Why would an developer DELETE features like that and limit their software? ','?'
'id: 4192 ',' Now I need a new app and need to transfer over a Gig of documentation. ','?'
'id: 4198 ',' \\n\\nI would suggest testing before deploying new software. ','?'
'id: 4200 ',' First off, the app freezes and crashes too often and the most inopportune times. ','?'
'id: 4200 ',' \\n\\nAlso, the app needs a little better design, maybe color coding or something to differentiate your notebooks. ','?'
'id: 4201 ',' I expect greater reliability and am not happy to have to uninstall, reinstall and resync (which did fix the problem). ','?'
'id: 4202 ',' \\n\\nAlso, do we really need a new update almost every day? ','?'
'id: 4204 ',' Keeps crashing , ','?'
'id: 4205 ',' \\n\\nI think the EN team need to really go and study the purpose of UI . ','?'
'id: 4209 ',' I just lost a few days of notes from an important conference. ','?'
'id: 4209 ',' \\n\\nI checked with google and many other people have had similar issues where data syncs don  t keep the correct versions. ','?'
'id: 4211 ',' I think evernote should add an option to not sync every time I open the app. ','?'
'id: 4216 ',' Every tap requires a several second long pause. ','?'
'id: 4219 ',' Great app, keep adding my notes. ','?'
'id: 4222 ',' I created a new note today and Evernote titled it with   Lyn  s Birthday  . ','?'
'id: 4227 ',' I don  t need a update every week. ','?'
'id: 4228 ',' I can  t even open Evernote without it crashing...even after the update. ','?'
'id: 4228 ',' \\n\\nCan  t believe I rely so much on this app and how much the Evernote team has failed me. ','?'
'id: 4230 ',' Why can  t we have the same interface as the PC version? ','?'
'id: 4233 ',' Yes, there is an issue with sync that is causing some note changes to not display. ','?'
'id: 4235 ',' \\n\\nThe only change that has yet to be made, which would require six stars, is better control for nested lists. ','?'
'id: 4243 ',' It needs to fix the bugs it  s really annoying , ','?'
'id: 4245 ',' What was so wrong with the old 5.x interface? ','?'
'id: 4250 ',' \\n\\nGlad you can now edit notes since that lack was truly a pain. ','?'
'id: 4256 ',' I think there is time? ','?'
'id: 4259 ',' Fair enough, but why would one spend money to do that after this disastrous new version? ','?'
'id: 4261 ',' Uninstalling and reinstalling app fixed it, but apparently a lot of users are having the same problem. ','?'
'id: 4261 ',' Stupid that this bug hasn  t been fixed yet and I have to search around on forums to figure out how to fix this. ','?'
'id: 4262 ',' \\n\\nEither way you have to wait, making Evernote increasingly useless for note taking. ','?'
'id: 4262 ',' \\n\\nIn the old days Evernote you could at least trigger a manual sync with one touch from the main screen. ','?'
'id: 4263 ',' Recently though it continues to crash. ','?'
'id: 4264 ',' It crashes, it freezes, won  t sync notes to my iPad without encountering an error. ','?'
'id: 4273 ',' Please bring search back to the home screen. ','?'
'id: 4275 ',' Stability could be worked on from engineering side. ','?'
'id: 4279 ',' Upgraded to the newest iPhone 5s and now ever note fails every time I open it. ','?'
'id: 4280 ',' Both the application and the browser version on my iPad 2 are crashing, burning, and totally failing. ','?'
'id: 4281 ',' The UI is confusing, and it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 4283 ',' It has some bugs and some design flaws, but the team is constantly working to iron things out. ','?'
'id: 4285 ',' This app provides a great solution for keeping my random stuff organized! ','?'
'id: 4288 ',' Please fix it now! ','?'
'id: 4289 ',' t need constant interface update, we need stability and functionality improvement. ','?'
'id: 4289 ',' Why can? ','?'
'id: 4289 ',' Why Evernote still cannot do this? ','?'
'id: 4290 ',' \\nSpeed needs to be improved on the iphone app. ','?'
'id: 4290 ',' Ill add that I think there should be a shortcut to add quick notes from the home screen. ','?'
'id: 4294 ',' Evernote has a lot of potential, but they desperately need to get their act together. ','?'
'id: 4295 ',' There is still room for improvement of course, but as of now I use Evernote to save anything and everything I need to remember. ','?'
'id: 4298 ',' Please please please make UNDO button! ','?'
'id: 4298 ',' Consistency between font size b/w the app and the pc website, please! ','?'
'id: 4304 ',' Finally, syncing issues are AWFUL. ','?'
'id: 4306 ',' No idea how to quickly, intuitively create a new note book. ','?'
'id: 4307 ',' It crashed when I tried to connect it to other iphone apps (scanner pro) . ','?'
'id: 4308 ',' I used to love Evernote since I kept story notes on it but now I can  t even access half of them through my phone :/ , ','?'
'id: 4309 ',' The new update is a good idea but the implementation isn  t quite to my liking. ','?'
'id: 4309 ',' It needs a little easier access to recent notes (right now you can only see 2!) ','?'
'id: 4310 ',' The user interface could use some work   it  s difficult to edit things on a mobile device when you  re away from the computer. ','?'
'id: 4310 ',' The general idea of the app is a great one and I started to use it to store our grocery list on   however, it constantly crashes and when you update the grocery list on one device and then get to the store oftentimes the updates are not there or there  s been a conflict so then there are two lists you don  t know which one is which! ','?'
'id: 4311 ',' This app had worked nicely before, but the new version crashes every time. ','?'
'id: 4312 ',' I have not had any major problems with this app. ','?'
'id: 4314 ',' I clicked a link in one of my notes, Safari opened, I read what I needed to read, clicked Done and. ','?'
'id: 4317 ',' What happened to this app?? ','?'
'id: 4317 ',' The only way I can get it to sync to my iPhone is to delete the app then re install it. ','?'
'id: 4321 ',' \\n\\nApp development will occasionally run into bugs, HOWEVER, if the main selling points if your app are reliability and access from anywhere, this is more than a bug. ','?'
'id: 4323 ',' I don  t write reviews, but this has SO impacted the way I work that it NEEDS to be fixed. ','?'
'id: 4324 ',' App does not work at all. ','?'
'id: 4325 ',' Does everything I need it to do. ','?'
'id: 4327 ',' Excellent app but the other day it did not update entry from iPad note to desktop. ','?'
'id: 4327 ',' No big deal but it would be nice if they fix that small error. ','?'
'id: 4329 ',' Well, I can quickly get used to iOS7 but I failed to get used to new Evernote so far. ','?'
'id: 4329 ',' Please bring back the old interface even if it  s skeuomorpic. ','?'
'id: 4330 ',' But please change this version. ','?'
'id: 4330 ',' I know you will make this better. ','?'
'id: 4330 ',' Please change it back or make full fledged changes. ','?'
'id: 4334 ',' I can  t think of a reason to give it four. ','?'
'id: 4334 ',' As for me, rather than looking for what  s wrong with it I  m going to try to figure out everything I can about how to use it better and better. ','?'
'id: 4335 ',' \\n I would like to see the ability to pick the thumbnail  s picture in the iOS version. ','?'
'id: 4340 ',' could they even do it? ','?'

'id: 4992 ',' I have had synchronization issues with it but since that has not been a problem for me, it is not an issue. ','?'
'id: 4993 ',' One wishlist item would be to allow a more scalable solution for adding sub items within notebooks (much like a file system method). ','?'
'id: 4994 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 4996 ',' I can  t even comment on the redesign, what with not having any of my notes in the app. ','?'
'id: 4996 ',' Really hope this is some temporary glitch, but honestly not expecting a lot from this company anymore. ','?'

'id: 5086 ',' But everyone has their limits, and mine are determined by the things I need to get done in life and how Evernote was supposed to help, not hinder, those goals. ','?'

'id: 5092 ',' I  ve been told they  re aware of it and will be fixing it soon, but the thing about being used as a mission critical app, where you store all your information, is that it  s kind of a big deal when suddenly you can  t access that information in the go, which is precisely why I chose Evernote and pay for a premium subscription.

'id: 5245 ',' \\n10/3/13  your sync feature is not properly working and is causing "conflict" among all my devices. ','?'
'id: 5245 ',' You guys need to do a better job if you want people to continue using this product. ','?'
'id: 5251 ',' The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version, but overall functionality is pretty good. ','?'
'id: 5253 ',' When I need to make a quick note I  m often left dealing with the friction of hitting the wrong thing or stopping to stare at it. ','?'
'id: 5255 ',' Plus the iOS version was the "how not to make it intuitive" version. ','?'
'id: 5267 ',' Since the new release, I typically have to delete the app and re install a couple of times a day . . . because it freezes, crashes, or stops syncing altogether. ','?'
'id: 5269 ',' Please update your app to support iOS 6 as well. ','?'
'id: 5272 ',' I  a paid user and since the update the app crashes! ','?'
'id: 5274 ',' So it  s $50 to have the only premium "feature" I need. ','?'
'id: 5274 ',' Update made my data less secure and extorting me to lock it down. ','?'
'id: 5279 ',' Latest version constantly crashes , ','?'
'id: 5281 ',' The other day, it wrote over changes I made on another device weeks ago and would not let me view my notes based on the notebook. ','?'
'id: 5281 ',' Today, it won  t let me delete a note I added accidentally. ','?'
'id: 5285 ',' Please fix   new iOS making it hard to use. ','?'
'id: 5286 ',' Five stars, if the strange bug re: the printing of italics could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 5288 ',' New version continually requires me to login in again when I open the app. ','?'
'id: 5292 ',' This thing needs a lot of work. ','?'
'id: 5295 ',' This app needs to be complete overhauled. ','?'
'id: 5295 ',' Why is the home level a green stripe on a quarter of my already tiny display? ','?'
'id: 5296 ',' Try adding a pic into a note and you end up scrolling all the way down for Todays pics but yesterdays pics are way on top. ','?'
'id: 5302 ',' Please fix Evernote because it keeps crashing and freezing after opening app. ','?'
'id: 5308 ',' Please fix the app so I don  t have to log in every time I need to access it. ','?'
'id: 5310 ',' Like other users have reported, when you open the app it freezes and you have to double click home to kill it off. ','?'
'id: 5310 ',' If you can get it to run (there are tricks) then you have to deal with the ridiculous interface   like scrolling to the bottom to see a square list that has a couple of notebooks listed, not all. ','?'
'id: 5310 ',' There are so many other design metaphors available, it  s crazy why they went this way. ','?'
'id: 5311 ',' Constantly crashes. ','?'
'id: 5313 ',' Please fix ASAP or give back the previous version. ','?'
'id: 5316 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 5316 ',' I really want / need a proper Evernote! ','?'
'id: 5317 ',' \\n\\nClean up the UI and get rid if the ads and you might have something. ','?'
'id: 5319 ',' Here are my two problems in iOS7:  \\n1. ','?'
'id: 5321 ',' Do not update it. ','?'
'id: 5321 ',' Once you update your screen freezes and your notes freezes with it. ','?'
'id: 5321 ',' Please tell me how to get back to my notes. ','?'
'id: 5323 ',' Please please revert back! ','?'
'id: 5324 ',' If you use Evernote you need this app. ','?'
'id: 5330 ',' Now it crashes every time it  s opened. ','?'
'id: 5333 ',' Occasional bugs but nothing is perfect , ','?'
'id: 5334 ',' Before iOS7, this app ran pretty smoothly and didn  t have any problems. ','?'
'id: 5334 ',' There are numerous glitches (perhaps the biggest and most annoying is the nearly constant keyboard/typing lag) and despite coming out with updates seemingly every other day, not a single one has made the slightest difference. ','?'
'id: 5334 ',' But you need a LOT of work to get the app back to where it was , ','?'
'id: 5335 ',' Evernote needs to stop jerking around with ads and marketplaces and make sure basic features still work. ','?'
'id: 5336 ',' App is constantly crashing with update , ','?'
'id: 5337 ',' Will synch new notes added, but if I edit an existing note on another device this app will not reflect the update no matter how many times I synch both devices. ','?'
'id: 5338 ',' I have had zero sync issues! ','?'
'id: 5339 ',' I did enjoy the old version very much and there are tons of potential features but I open it and I can  t use it for at least 30 secs and it will crash and go into delete apps mode if I touch it during that time, and how the heck do u change the title of a note, seriously?! ','?'
'id: 5340 ',' It is the most useful app I have because it is so versatile and is available on all my devices. ','?'
'id: 5345 ',' What happened to the Atlas feature? ','?'
'id: 5345 ',' Or am I just missing it. ','?'
'id: 5345 ',' With this version of Evernote, it does not support Tag names longer than like 6 or 8 characters and if you have many similar Tag names, they are completely indistinguishable from each other! ','?'
'id: 5345 ',' Once you search a TAG and view notes related to that TAG, there is NO WAY to get back to the home screen that I can see   short of forcing the program closed and re opening it on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 5345 ',' IF there is a way, it is not intuitive and has completely escaped me. ','?'
'id: 5350 ',' This is ESPECIALLY FRUSTRATING, because the Windows version just added this approach, and I was looking forward to more a consistent experience across platforms. ','?'
'id: 5354 ',' It would be nice if you could make reminders/insert link to a reminders inside notes. ','?'
'id: 5354 ',' It would also be nice if you could see PDF files in the note itself instead of a link you have to open 1st. ','?'
'id: 5359 ',' The changes EN has made to its most current version are great  cleaner interface, better tools and overall just a real WOW factor. ','?'
'id: 5362 ',' I know it  s a note app however I wish there were more features such as drawing in the notes, image resizing, adding boxes/charts etc, and maybe highlighting. ','?'
'id: 5364 ',' I use it to for so many functions from notes to remember, ideas that are important, thoughts, creating references from various scriptures and organizing them into reference books according to their application, and keeping synced from mobile to computer. ','?'
'id: 5365 ',' Evernote provides NO way to reconcile a sync error   you just have to remake the note or complete notebook! ','?'
'id: 5366 ',' Ever since I updated to IOS 7(iPad) there is a very annoying bug that when you  re writing your note and get to the bottom of the page, instead of rolling down progressively (as it used to), it starts to jump way down with every letter you type, which means you can  t longer see what you  re writing! ','?'
'id: 5366 ',' Please please fix it as soon as possible, I always recommend Evernote but this bug is making me regret it! ','?'
'id: 5367 ',' crittercatz ,  I can  t do anything. ','?'
'id: 5368 ',' If you open a picture note, you have to expand the picture to see the buttons to return back to the note. ','?'
'id: 5368 ',' Took me a while to figure out how to get out of a picture. ','?'
'id: 5369 ',' I love Evernote, it helps me remember and prioritize everything I need to get done. ','?'
'id: 5373 ',' \\n\\nFinally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag. ','?'
'id: 5374 ',' They really need to update this soon or people who rely on it for work will start moving on. ','?'
'id: 5382 ',' It keeps telling me that I need to buy premium and it  s annoying. ','?'
'id: 5383 ',' My only major issue with the iOS app was that it didn  t display annotations (highlighting, comments, etc) contained within PDFs; a feature which has since been added. ','?'
'id: 5384 ',' Once you become used to using it instead of post its, Notes, or emails to yourself (that  s what I used to do) them it is indispensable, and I  ve barely scratched the surface of how to use all the features. ','?'
'id: 5385 ',' You can  t change text size, the bullet points are harder to use. ','?'
'id: 5387 ',' alyssalianna ,  Unless they  re hidden deep inside some random settings folder, it seems that the text size options have been removed. ','?'
'id: 5393 ',' A lot of people have been complaining about the update, but I have had zero problems and actually love the new look and design. ','?'
'id: 5396 ',' Synch does not work anymore. ','?'
'id: 5397 ',' \\n\\nI have not had sync issues. ','?'
'id: 5397 ',' \\n\\nI would suggest adding SEARCH to the "main menu" (home) panel. ','?'
'id: 5397 ',' Also suggest keep focusing on speed and efficiency of making/finding notes (rather than adding dumb bulky features like related/recent notes that appeared annoyingly at the bottom of all my notes in version 6.) ','?'
'id: 5399 ',' Layout of tags, notes, notebooks could be improved. ','?'
'id: 5405 ',' \\n\\nThe teaser video was promising, but in the wild, the app fails to deliver yet again. ','?'
'id: 5405 ',' Please don  t change the UI. ','?'
'id: 5405 ',' \\n\\n  being a premium subscriber, why do I have to view ads? ','?'
'id: 5405 ',' I ask where the pride is in the usability of their app? ','?'
'id: 5405 ',' The same problems that plagued them on day one are still here. ','?'
'id: 5405 ',' I need to depend on this app and its contents. ','?'
'id: 5406 ',' Personally, I like the new UI and haven  t had any problems with functionality. ','?'
'id: 5408 ',' notnewt ,  It  s a great idea and something I really need  unfortunately I  ve been unable to get it to work. ','?'
'id: 5408 ',' It keeps telling me I need to enable cookies on my computer. ','?'
'id: 5409 ',' Every time I learn how to do any task the next time requires more learning curve. ','?'
'id: 5410 ',' Also crashed every time I tried to open one note in particular. ','?'
'id: 5414 ',' A flatter version of the older design is all we needed! ','?'
'id: 5415 ',' I love this app for taking notes and holding files, but I wish that once you had notes, you could make a folder, and transfer and/or copy notes into the new folder instead of only being able to make a folder and then start putting notes in it. ','?'
'id: 5417 ',' I do not have iOS7 so maybe that  s why i haven  t had any problems. ','?'
'id: 5418 ',' I am a college student, before the iOS 7 update I would use Evernote to take notes in class on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 5418 ',' When Apple made iOS 7 they made it more simple without losing any attractive features. ','?'
'id: 5418 ',' Following Apple  s lead, Evernote attempted to do the same thing but they removed all of the features that made me like the program. ','?'
'id: 5418 ',' If i wanted plain text I would use "Notes" which comes standard on all iDevices. ','?'
'id: 5421 ',' \\n\\nEvernote used to be OK, it had bugs but was manageable. ','?'
'id: 5424 ',' I love the new Evernote, and the recent update fixed the bugs I had. ','?'
'id: 5424 ',' You can now use skitch features directly in evernotes  s interface, thank you! ','?'
'id: 5429 ',' The new UI just isn  t what I want to work with , ','?'
'id: 5430 ',' I love this app please fix ASAP! ','?'
'id: 5431 ',' Sync is nice, but I  m ready to find something simpler with less overhead that can support customers who aren  t beating down the door for the next OS update. ','?'
'id: 5433 ',' Evernote needs to fix this. ','?'
'id: 5434 ',' Should be a clearer layout\\nShould be a way to delete photos by tapping on them\\n\\nCould put photos in groups  so you can make notes on same topic\\nBc when you take a picture they all go into the same note, no way to separate them(on iOS device)\\n\\nShould be an export to PDF option (if their isn  t already)\\n\\nShould be able to create different subjects for work. ','?'
'id: 5434 ',' For example it would be great if you could have a "page" for every subject, and you could slide left   right to access them, or go to menu and view them vertically aligned. ','?'
'id: 5437 ',' Why would I pay for special features let alone continue to use this app? ','?'
'id: 5438 ',' And being a premium member I don  t need to see your market place and product placements. ','?'
'id: 5438 ',' You must be kidding! ','?'
'id: 5440 ',' This version crashes constantly and forces paying "premium" customers to see ads for useless evernote branded merchandise. ','?'
'id: 5441 ',' When do companies update something and it just does not work as well? ','?'
'id: 5444 ',' Please fix ASAP. ','?'
'id: 5446 ',' The desktop app is great, but this iOS 7 version requires you to log in again after a very short time, which makes taking quick notes impossible. ','?'
'id: 5446 ',' But don  t wait forever to fix it, or lots of us will just switch to something else! ','?'
'id: 5447 ',' The suite of Evernote apps, applications, and plug ins work together almost seamlessly, with the exception of iOS Skitch and Penultimate crashing on me a total of like 4 times each. ','?'
'id: 5448 ',' Evernote needs to fix this quick. ','?'
'id: 5449 ',' Worked pretty good on prior release...able to import several images quickly...its now a pain in the a. as you have to click several times to just do one image and its real slow. ','?'
'id: 5451 ',' \\n\\nThat is if I can find out how to indent. ','?'
'id: 5451 ',' This provided the ability to do many formatting changes to notes you take. ','?'
'id: 5451 ',' If this option is truly removed then I will really have to rethink how I take my notes. ','?'
'id: 5451 ',' \\n\\nI still like the app and do not think it deserves a low review, but one of my most used features might have just been removed. ','?'
'id: 5453 ',' New version crashes upon each load and will not allow notes to view. ','?'
'id: 5454 ',' The "card" view of notes has been removed leaving only a simple note list that is far more difficult to navigate. ','?'
'id: 5457 ',' 1   does not work offline\\n2   each time asks for password\\n3   why have U decided that past version of Labels View was bad? ','?'
'id: 5459 ',' Events should have its own card. ','?'
'id: 5461 ',' The Done button is not working. ','?'
'id: 5464 ',' For God  s sake you are actually trying to sell Evernote socks? ','?'
'id: 5465 ',' I love that I don  t need to use the same device all the time in order to keep everything together! ','?'
'id: 5468 ',' This is a great app but after the update it crash and it looks horrible. ','?'
'id: 5471 ',' This new version crashes every time I try to open it. ','?'
'id: 5479 ',' Since updating to the latest version it simply freezes and eventually crashes every single time I open it. ','?'
'id: 5480 ',' why would I open your app to get to my photos instead of just going to my photos? ','?'
'id: 5482 ',' Please please fix this! ','?'
'id: 5482 ',' Please please fix ASAP! ','?'
'id: 5483 ',' I would like to use Evernote full time, it has a lot of powerful features that I find useful, but this app feels like it was made for people who are already members of the cult. ','?'
'id: 5484 ',' I need you guys to put my shortcuts on the front page again. ','?'
'id: 5485 ',' Can  t recommend it highly enough. ','?'
'id: 5487 ',' I just want a simple way to create, view and organize my notes. ','?'
'id: 5488 ',' Chapeleiro_mad ,  The app does not support huge notes, it will crash if you try to export a note with more then 100Mb (with pdfs and audio notes). ','?'
'id: 5488 ',' the note to iTunes, so you have to send a 100Mb file by e mail. ','?'
'id: 5489 ',' Evernote is big enough to know how to test their software. ','?'
'id: 5491 ',' It is by far the best solution. ','?'
'id: 5493 ',' \\n\\nAlso, they keep adding gratuitous features that get between me and my notes! ','?'
'id: 5498 ',' Come on guys, please fix this problem soon. ','?'
'id: 5499 ',' The sync fails. ','?'
'id: 5499 ',' Absolutely crashes and will crash your iPad also. ','?'
'id: 5502 ',' I was looking for an app to take pictures of my notes, i do little sketches on post it notes, and i loose, misplace them all the time. ','?'
'id: 5506 ',' Sure, there are some issues, inconveniences, etc but overall it  s been very helpful for me. ','?'
'id: 5506 ',' Bottom line: DON  T update your Evernote app until they fix this issue! ','?'
'id: 5508 ',' iOS7 update crashes regularly with a large PDF file open. ','?'
'id: 5508 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 5511 ',' Adding a tag used to be easy: tap to expand the list, scroll down, tap to add one or several tags, so easy. ','?'
'id: 5513 ',' GCSWT ,  Can  t live without Evernote, but this version crashes way too much. ','?'
'id: 5518 ',' Five years I  ve used your app not any more and won  t suggest it anymore either. ','?'
'id: 5520 ',' magnum6 ,  What happened to this app? ','?'
'id: 5522 ',' How is 4 touches easier than 2? ','?'
'id: 5522 ',' Has never failed to sync. ','?'
'id: 5522 ',' Unless I  m missing something, you can  t do that with evernote  you have to choose one of their pre selectable methods for the order of your list. ','?'
'id: 5522 ',' One thing I really like about evernote is that backup is never an issue because the syncs across all of my devices have worked instantly and flawlessly, and the data then resides on each device, in case of failure of any one device. ','?'
'id: 5524 ',' Xillio ,  It crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 5525 ',' Why not to fix bugs and release a stable update one day later? ','?'
'id: 5529 ',' Notepad kept losing my notes and a friend recommended Evernote. ','?'
'id: 5529 ',' \\n\\nThese things just scratch the surface, I organize my life through Evernote, I keep notes on everything and I mean EVERYTHING in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 5530 ',' Other apps require manual cropping of notes and such, but the feature in EverNote automatically cropped the Post it when I photographed it. ','?'
'id: 5536 ',' In the first version of Evernote 7, I had a bad typing lag problem but the most recent update fixed that issue. ','?'
'id: 5537 ',' Maybe it will work better after my 5S arrives. ','?'
'id: 5541 ',' Good thing I didn  t have to pay for my premium account as I was referred by a friend. ','?'
'id: 5543 ',' \\nWill watch for patches and post an updated review. ','?'
'id: 5545 ',' It would  ve great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data. ','?'
'id: 5548 ',' Adding an Evernote "store" (Market) into the app was the last straw. ','?'
'id: 5549 ',' There are security issues with the latest update. ','?'
'id: 5549 ',' This needs fixing ASAP. ','?'
'id: 5550 ',' Yes, it had a few bugs, but I assumed that the Evernote Execs would fix problems in their updates. ','?'
'id: 5550 ',' \\n\\nIn Outlook, for example, you can create sub folders for your files without limit. ','?'
'id: 5556 ',' Now my AppStore says I have an update available but I can  t update OR remove that notification because I won  t update my iPad to iOS 7. ','?'
'id: 5557 ',' I never had that problem with the previous version (before ios7). ','?'
'id: 5560 ',' I can  t get the app to open on my iPhone, yet it works fine on my iPad...please fix ASAP , ','?'
'id: 5561 ',' Cannot type a note at full screen? ','?'
'id: 5561 ',' Why can you only edit notes w/half screen on note and half with a list of your notes? ','?'
'id: 5561 ',' I don  t need to see a list of my notes the ENTIRE time I  m typing. ','?'
'id: 5562 ',' I know you  re thinking "big deal", but if you aim to have any sort of organization in your life, or want to improve it, this is the way to do it. ','?'
'id: 5562 ',' I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone because it  s just an overall amazing app!! ','?'
'id: 5563 ',' Get used to learning how to reuse Evernote again, and again, and again. ','?'
'id: 5563 ',' \\nI need a third party app to access my Evernote data, anyone have any ideas? ','?'
'id: 5565 ',' Why should I continue to pay $5 for a company that ignores its customer  s repeated requests for a meaningful update to the functionality of the software? ','?'
'id: 5565 ',' I don  t need a new, innovative, card style UI design. ','?'
'id: 5565 ',' I need the ability to scribble drawings next to what I  ve typed! ','?'
'id: 5566 ',' What happened to the ability to add a link? ','?'
'id: 5569 ',' 1 if they added a feature that would allow me to "backdate" my entries/notes. ','?'
'id: 5571 ',' I can  t click on it or delete it and it looks like this weird gray blueprint looking thing. ','?'
'id: 5574 ',' Please fix this so I can use them. ','?'
'id: 5576 ',' It still allows bolding, italicizing, and underlining, and has for some unknown reason added the ability to choose between left , center , and right alignment, but without the ability to format sections, subsections, and block quotes, 75 minutes of class notes start to look fairly unorganized fairly quickly. ','?'
'id: 5582 ',' And I really love that they  re always trying to improve upon it that  s a great thing keep it up!!!! ','?'
'id: 5591 ',' There are some very real bugs in the updated Evernote! ','?'
'id: 5592 ',' Send feedback or send a report from the phone does not work either. ','?'
'id: 5597 ',' I have no problems with this application at all. ','?'
'id: 5599 ',' How about a fix Evernote? ','?'
'id: 5600 ',' nflyt12 ,  Works great on iPad, Mac and PC but when I start the app on iPhone iOS 7 it sits on the flash screen for 30 seconds then crashes. ','?'
'id: 5602 ',' To go back new iOS had given a shortcut please use it. ','?'
'id: 5604 ',' First, I think the contrast on the note attachment menus needs improvement. ','?'
'id: 5604 ',' Second, please bring back tag scrolling on individual notes. ','?'
'id: 5608 ',' But the new camera for the app is not nearly as efficient at taking pictures and adding them to the note. ','?'
'id: 5608 ',' But until I am able to use it again for what I need it for (without having to pay $50 for premium), two stars is the most I will give. ','?'
'id: 5609 ',' I, like others, was missing a lot of notes on my phone strangely. ','?'
'id: 5616 ',' Why is it so difficult to find anything? ','?'
'id: 5616 ',' How about a search button right on the front page instead of   announcements   taking up valuable real estate? ','?'
'id: 5616 ',' Why do I need to choose business or personal before I search? ','?'
'id: 5616 ',' \\n\\nI brought this into my business, taught everyone how to use it, and now I  m wishing I had chosen a different route. ','?'
'id: 5616 ',' \\n\\nI need access to my notes and I need it easy and FAST! ','?'
'id: 5618 ',' I now have a growing collection of my personal files anywhere I go, with off line iPad support, and I have no problems managing my content on 3 different platforms   MacBook at home, Windows at work and iPad on the go. ','?'
'id: 5620 ',' The option to bold, italicize, and underline along with adding bullets and numbers is very useful. ','?'
'id: 5622 ',' Whenever I try to take a picture into a note, the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 5623 ',' I am very unhappy that a note I was creating did not automatically save when exiting evernote. ','?'
'id: 5625 ',' I doubt this is an Evernote only problem, especially since the whole system seems to be slower now. ','?'
'id: 5625 ',' No need to bring a PC to the meetings. ','?'
'id: 5631 ',' Obviously a glitch that needs fixed ASAP. ','?'
'id: 5633 ',' The update looks like it might be interesting but I can  t evaluate it because most of my notes are missing. ','?'
'id: 5633 ',' You just introduce them and I love the idea but they seem to be missing from the UI. ','?'
'id: 5636 ',' How the heck do I delete a note now? ','?'
'id: 5637 ',' I just closed it and restarted it ten times in a row, and every time it just froze. ','?'
'id: 5639 ',' My colleagues recommended this app. ','?'
'id: 5640 ',' I cannot alter note indentations unless I  m in a bulleted or numbered list now, and my phone which I kept on iOS 6 cannot use the new version! ','?'
'id: 5642 ',' The latest version does not work at all. ','?'
'id: 5643 ',' Now with iOS 7 it frequently crashes and often notebooks go missing and the app must be restarted. ','?'
'id: 5646 ',' I think you should balance more the colors, use more white instead of green. ','?'
'id: 5649 ',' None of my notes are available to load. ','?'
'id: 5653 ',' workds fantastic and available in all the plateform i am using. ','?'

'id: 5680 ',' You have successfully created complexity from simplicity   chaos from what used to be orderly. ','?'

'id: 5680 ',' You had something awesome, then thought you would try to be like Apple. ','?'
'id: 5693 ',' The part that I most liked about Evernote and the main reason that I would use it was because of the different formatting features (different sizes for sections and subsections, indenting) these features are now no longer available. ','?'
'id: 5693 ',' Only simple and plain text are the two formatting options and the indent option is only available for bullets. ','?'
'id: 5693 ',' Because of this I will be searching for a new note taking app, very disappointed that these features are no longer available. ','?'
'id: 5694 ',' Unfortunately with the new update every time you delete a letter the screen jumps to the bottom of the screen, so you can  t see what you are typing and editing. ','?'
'id: 5695 ',' Never had this problem before the iOS7 update. ','?'
'id: 5697 ',' All of my other apps made the transition just fine except this one. ','?'
'id: 5697 ',' Everything I do causes it to lock up and crash! ','?'
'id: 5697 ',' Whoever developed this app should be fired and Evernote should hire someone competent to get a fix out there yesterday. ','?'
'id: 5707 ',' This is extremely easy to maneuver through and a lot less complicated, which is super useful when you have to take a note on a moments notice like I do almost everyday , ','?'
'id: 5715 ',' What did you do with Places? ','?'
'id: 5715 ',' What was wrong with the old version? ','?'
'id: 5718 ',' This app is crashing like crazy all of a sudden in ios7. ','?'
'id: 5721 ',' However, after updating my iPhone 5 to iOS 7.0, Evernote does not work! ','?'
'id: 5721 ',' Please fix whatever is going on. ','?'
'id: 5721 ',' I need my Evernote! ','?'
'id: 5725 ',' Clean new design, but ALL of my notes are missing except for the most recent 2. ','?'
'id: 5726 ',' It opens for one second and then crashes. ','?'
'id: 5727 ',' Just upgraded the app and all my old notes are gone. ','?'
'id: 5729 ',' It could be that I am missing a key setting that will give me back the ability to quickly see my notebooks but defaulting into unsorted notes in the order they were created is the opposite of helpful. ','?'
'id: 5731 ',' I use it all the time, please fix it so that when I do a search in the search box, I\\ncan find any related stuff throughout all notebooks not just the one I am searching in. ','?'
'id: 5731 ',' Am still getting to know how to use it on the iPhone so maybe there  s something else that I  m just not understanding...as an app it should be user friendly and straightforward. ','?'
'id: 5733 ',' \\n\\nThey need new programmers that care again about users. ','?'
'id: 5734 ',' My notes disappear frequently, and I  m being forced into a work flow that includes restarting the app every time I update a note. ','?'
'id: 5734 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 5737 ',' \\n\\nSometimes I have synchronization issues between my iPad and work Dell laptop, but generally it works fine. ','?'
'id: 5741 ',' Big problem for me as Evernote is one I my key apps. ','?'
'id: 5742 ',' I like Evernote not as much as pages but soooo much more than notability the one thing that i think is a down side for evernote is that you need wifi to open certain notes, i dont have wifi at my house  so its tricky, at the same time only certain notes will open i dont know why but then others say i need wifi. ','?'
'id: 5744 ',' It  s like adding a SIM card to your head! ','?'
'id: 5744 ',' If you  re reading this and you haven  t downloaded yet, how have you survived life up until now? ','?'
'id: 5744 ',' \\n\\nI highly recommend buying an Evernote 101 type e book. ','?'
'id: 5745 ',' This is obviously a huge problem and renders this app pretty useless, not to mention it  s extremely frustrating for those of us who depended on having our notes available always. ','?'
'id: 5749 ',' Feels more fluid, controls are intuitive and exactly where I expect them to be. ','?'
'id: 5750 ',' Even with a Premium account I was unable to view the history and restore my note. ','?'
'id: 5750 ',' \\n\\nAlso, it needs tabs, sections and indents like OneNote   tags just aren  t as easy to navigate and organize. ','?'
'id: 5750 ',' It also needs better text editing (especially with bullets, tables, drag and drop of lines/sub lines, font coloring, styles, right click hyperlinking, keyboard shortcuts, Outlook integration, task types, templates, multi user authoring) and improved import and export from OneNote. ','?'
'id: 5756 ',' First problem is (just like Mailbox) the app doesn  t remember login and keeps forcing me to log in each time I open the app fresh. ','?'
'id: 5756 ',' \\n\\nSecond problem is the new home screen design requires too much reading to know where your stuff is. ','?'
'id: 5756 ',' \\n\\nNot sure why the app needed so much retooling just to match the iOS look. ','?'
'id: 5757 ',' However I had to remove it since with it open my iPhone 5 freezes and I just get a black screen. ','?'
'id: 5759 ',' I really enjoyed the app until the updated version for iOS7 came out, now I am having problems all over the place. ','?'
'id: 5762 ',' Does not work with iOS 6; I love the app, but I don  t have iOS 7. ','?'
'id: 5763 ',' I used Evernote years ago when it first came out but had to stop because I kept getting burned. ','?'
'id: 5763 ',' I would take extensive notes on my phone and the sync would fail and delete everything I typed. ','?'
'id: 5764 ',' app now crashes on launch 100% of the time, for a few weeks now. ','?'
'id: 5764 ',' a major app should have vastly better quality control than this. ','?'
'id: 5768 ',' I have a huge problem with the fact that Evernote  s new update has done away with the text formatting options. ','?'
'id: 5768 ',' That was one of the features I needed most. ','?'
'id: 5769 ',' I like most of it\\n\\nBest feature: the quick access buttons although I wish you can customize it a bit. ','?'
'id: 5769 ',' It crashes about 10 20% of the time. ','?'
'id: 5769 ',' And then when I tried I got an error. ','?'
'id: 5769 ',' That is the power of Evernote from the beginning: OCD and disorganized people alike can use Evernote. ','?'
'id: 5769 ',' \\n\\nSo Evernote released a "pretty" looking App that needs a major rethink. ','?'
'id: 5770 ',' I try manually syncing but still my existing notes do not load. ','?'
'id: 5771 ',' Makes me think I should stop using this system. ','?'
'id: 5772 ',' Major changes in user interface should be released under a new App. ','?'
'id: 5772 ',' \\n\\nThe new background updating feature requires enabling notifications. ','?'
'id: 5778 ',' I imagine you  re already addressing this, but I wanted to go on record that this is an issue on my iPhone 5. ','?'
'id: 5781 ',' Notes don  t sync for me, I just have a bunch of empty notebooks, and people are reporting actually losing all their data. ','?'
'id: 5782 ',' \\n\\nOnly problem is that your tag list doesn  t always pop up when you try to add a tag to a note on iPhone5. ','?'
'id: 5783 ',' \\n\\nThe only issue I have is well the most important issue. ','?'
'id: 5786 ',' There are two problems I  ve encountered with this update, however. ','?'
'id: 5787 ',' I rely and this app for so much and I basically cannot use it without all of my notes being synced. ','?'
'id: 5787 ',' This needs to be fixed immediately please! ','?'
'id: 5788 ',' nted ,  Loved Evernote before but now does not work on 5S. ','?'
'id: 5789 ',' Fix it, please. ','?'
'id: 5790 ',' All of my notebooks are missing and I hate that to use it off line I will have to go premium. ','?'
'id: 5791 ',' I haven  t had problems with it prior to this update. ','?'
'id: 5792 ',' I am a little worried, however, that I need access to the Internet for it. ','?'
'id: 5792 ',' Not sure if this will work then. ','?'
'id: 5793 ',' I am guessing this is just an iOS7 issue. ','?'
'id: 5793 ',' \\n\\nYou can no longer create titles or subsections. ','?'
'id: 5797 ',' I  ve run into multiple bugs, and little quirks that should have been taken care of (like the tiny viewing space to see what you just typed in landscape mode). ','?'
'id: 5800 ',' LilGingerz ,  Why can  t I open it with my ios7? ','?'
'id: 5804 ',' Please help devs! ','?'
'id: 5805 ',' Let  s try to keep the layout for a while and just do tweaks for enhancements and performance. ','?'
'id: 5807 ',' \\n\\nNow I will be looking for something else to use, and will let my Premium subscription expire. ','?'
'id: 5812 ',' You need to be able to see a list of all notes, sorted by recently modified. ','?'
'id: 5813 ',' Definitely recommend to update. ','?'
'id: 5815 ',' I  m sure another release will be out shortly to fix the issues. ','?'
'id: 5815 ',' Mine have been minor issues. ','?'
'id: 5816 ',' Love this app, but ever since I updated my iPhone 4 this morning this app isn  t functioning properly. ','?'
'id: 5820 ',' Evernote really needs to go back to the basics, there is just way to much going on in the dashboard. ','?'
'id: 5820 ',' If it  s built for iOS 7 it should have a simple beautiful interface. ','?'
'id: 5822 ',' Since one of those notes is my Mom  s medical info which I refer to frequently, this is a serious problem. ','?'
'id: 5825 ',' And the update is UGLY...altho since all my notes are missing maybe that  s where the the "beautiful interface" is they  re referencing. ','?'
'id: 5831 ',' I did have some sync issues, but got resolved by deleting and reinstalling it again. ','?'
'id: 5842 ',' But:\\n  No way to delete note from it  s view. ','?'
'id: 5842 ',' But in iPhone version list is not always visible and sometimes (like navigating to note from home screen) you can  t easily navigate back to list containing that note\\n  App uses non standard navigation controller and swipe from left to go back is not working. ','?'
'id: 5842 ',' Manual sync did not work too. ','?'
'id: 5846 ',' However, I have an issue. ','?'
'id: 5846 ',' You have to do an extra tap to get that. ','?'
'id: 5847 ',' \\n\\nThe latest version constantly crashes, the paste function takes multiple taps to appear and is hit and miss, and the interface sometimes distorts and shows overlapped text and white space in the note snippet view. ','?'
'id: 5848 ',' I use it to store all sorts of data that I need to be able to recall quickly. ','?'
'id: 5849 ',' Great app but it should have the ability to delete a note when viewing the note. ','?'
'id: 5854 ',' The app worked great for a day, now it crashes every time I try to start it up. ','?'
'id: 5857 ',' \\n\\nAfter I updated the Evernote on my iOS 7 iPhone I found no notes available while all notebooks remained. ','?'
'id: 5857 ',' I would like to use the older version which might be a little more elegant and useful than this one. ','?'
'id: 5859 ',' Please restore asap. ','?'
'id: 5862 ',' Not only is the latest version gorgeous, I can also access things I need more quickly. ','?'
'id: 5866 ',' It is a great app and I will recommend it for any one who needs to start a project, school work or even for office use. ','?'
'id: 5869 ',' Sort function does not work. ','?'
'id: 5870 ',' And where in hell is the search function? ','?'
'id: 5872 ',' Why won  t this version remember me? ','?'
'id: 5872 ',' I see many others are having this issue too....is there a fix I this? ','?'
'id: 5873 ',' So how can I use the app? ','?'
'id: 5873 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 5877 ',' This app will not work on my iPhone 5 with iOS 7. ','?'
'id: 5878 ',' it has also crashed on me at least 5 times, need to fix it. ','?'
'id: 5887 ',' I use it everyday storing and retrieving information I require at a moments notice. ','?'
'id: 5889 ',' These 2 functions need to be quick and easy. ','?'
'id: 5889 ',' It really needs to be something on the home page. ','?'
'id: 5892 ',' They forgot the sign out button and now I  m stuck with an old account that  s not even valid any longer. ','?'
'id: 5893 ',' Then I missed the fact that the first screen is a create account screen and created a new account with the same email and password as my original account. ','?'
'id: 5898 ',' But there are many navigational issues   full screen notes view, highlighting and selection doesn  t function well, etc. ','?'
'id: 5901 ',' I love how developers try to update and make improvements always. ','?'
'id: 5902 ',' The IE web clipper does not work well for me tho. ','?'
'id: 5903 ',' Why have a retina display with such an awful background? ','?'
'id: 5904 ',' If you need any reason to convince you to switch, the new Evernote is definitely one. ','?'
'id: 5905 ',' Please fix this!!!! ','?'
'id: 5907 ',' \\n\\nthis would be 5 star review but there is one major flaw in new io7 version of Evernote ...when u go back to the app, it used to remain where u left off (on a certain note or notebook) now u have to weed through the system to get back or use favorites (both require more work than necessary) PLEASE MAKE THIS AN OPTION IN UPDATE !!!! ','?'
'id: 5911 ',' Please fix this please. ','?'
'id: 5912 ',' When typing the page scrolls down with each letter, so I cannot see what I am typing, and have to scroll up several pages in order to see what I just wrote. ','?'
'id: 5922 ',' The new apps surely provide a fresh overhaul of UI, but there seem to be some bugs that make these apps useless for me. ','?'
'id: 5922 ',' The apps have failed to get all my notes. ','?'
'id: 5922 ',' Evernote, please fix this. ','?'
'id: 5925 ',' Used to work with my iPod Touch 4th gen, but since I can  t upgrade to ios7, I  m left in the dust. ','?'
'id: 5931 ',' I  m a huge fan of Evernote and the iOS update looks fantastic, but what happened to all the formatting options? ','?'
'id: 5931 ',' \\n\\nGuess I have to figure something else out now, since my notes will be completely lacking in organization and depth. ','?'
'id: 5931 ',' There is room for them, please bring   em back! ','?'
'id: 5942 ',' Today I upgraded both iOS7 and Evernote, and when I went to open a note I found ALL of my notes are missing. ','?'
'id: 5943 ',' Most folks who are trashing this version need to chill. ','?'
'id: 5951 ',' I  m an Evernote premium user, but NEVER update my iOS on the first go round. ','?'
'id: 5951 ',' If I had known, I would not have updated Evernote? ','?'
'id: 5953 ',' However one major bug I noticed is that when I make a change to a note on the desktop version. ','?'
'id: 5955 ',' The same goes for creating a new note or editing of some notes when they pop up and leave the screen behind (not sure how to explain this)   it doesn  t use all of the screen. ','?'
'id: 5959 ',' It would be nice to mention this in your update. ','?'
'id: 5960 ',' I just think some improvements need to be made , ','?'
'id: 5967 ',' There is no way to ricover it. ','?'
'id: 5967 ',' Please bring back all my notes! ','?'
'id: 5968 ',' All I see is a white board and the keyboard and I have to pull the screen down to see what I just wrote. ','?'
'id: 5970 ',' It continues to crash , ','?'
'id: 5975 ',' Evernote  s version 7 update for iOS7 has made an amazing app even more amazing. ','?'
'id: 5976 ',' Please fix this, it crashes every time I try to open it. ','?'
'id: 5976 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 5980 ',' The only thing that missing that could make it better is that you could be able to draw. ','?'
'id: 5984 ',' Evernote needs to be in line with the usual crisp and simple design, rather than the current blocky color and messy way of putting everything all together. ','?'
'id: 5985 ',' \\n\\nFinally the feature that annoys me the most and has in EVERY version of Evernote is the automatic link created for dates and times. ','?'
'id: 5988 ',' Although now we can create stacks, it seems to me that most of the features the previous design had are gone. ','?'
'id: 5990 ',' Couldn  t create a new notebook, now app won  t run at all. ','?'
'id: 5994 ',' No issue there but the problem is that it keeps crashing!! ','?'
'id: 5996 ',' I think that needs to get fixed. ','?'
'id: 6007 ',' They should be fired. ','?'
'id: 6007 ',' \\n\\nI don  t get why you keeping pushing out features that aren  t liked by the majority who want to enjoy the app? ','?'
'id: 6007 ',' \\n\\nThis how it should be arranged:\\n\\nSearch bar near the name. ','?'
'id: 6007 ',' Tags should be implemented as one searches for their notes. ','?'
'id: 6009 ',' I just tested it on my iPad and the graphics are so well done. ','?'
'id: 6010 ',' This update will only run on iOS 7. ','?'
'id: 6017 ',' Where are old notes? ','?'
'id: 6018 ',' Please, dial back the green. ','?'
'id: 6021 ',' The larger issues is I have thousands of notes and only like 14 sync. ','?'
'id: 6024 ',' \\n\\nAnd still can  t edit notebook stacks on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 6026 ',' How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary? ','?'
'id: 6027 ',' All of my notes are missing! ','?'
'id: 6028 ',' Evernote is awesome but this new version failed to syn all my notes. ','?'
'id: 6035 ',' Space wizz ,  Either there  s some great feature that now requires iOS 7 or the iPhone 5S or 5C or the developers selected the wrong minimum iOS version when compiling the latest update, but Evernote is now one of 4 Apps that now don  t work on my iPhone 5 with iOS 6 , ','?'
'id: 6037 ',' Why could you not make this backward compatible and wait a couple of weeks for the kinks to get worked out of iOS7? ','?'
'id: 6043 ',' If you  re already a user of Evernote, do not install this update! ','?'
'id: 6044 ',' I updated the app and all my notes are not showing up. ','?'
'id: 6044 ',' \\n\\nPerhaps a lingering annoying bug that needs to be squashed immediately! ','?'
'id: 6045 ',' Hey, I can  t update right now so I can  t use an app. ','?'
'id: 6061 ',' Apparently, the new version isn  t just "compatible" with iOS7, but actually REQUIRES it. ','?'
'id: 6061 ',' I updated the app in iTunes, but received a message that my iPhone doesn  t have a high enough version of iOS so it won  t load. ','?'
'id: 6066 ',' Why the washed out green? ','?'
'id: 6066 ',' Where is the trademark Elephant logo? ','?'
'id: 6066 ',' I need to find a way to go back to the iOS 6 version , ','?'
'id: 6068 ',' On my iPad I will do more web and document capture and I use it in my PC to leverage what is in there. ','?'
'id: 6070 ',' Instead of having to have actual notebooks, I just created a different note book for each course I  m taking! ','?'
'id: 6070 ',' Also I recommend the sketch app so you can take pictures of hand drawings and put them in your notebooks. ','?'
'id: 6071 ',' I haven  t had any issues with it being slow, but I do wish I could edit power points and pdf  s.  Other than that it has worked wonderfully for me. ','?'
'id: 6074 ',' I hardly need to use my pen and paper anymore. ','?'
'id: 6080 ',' Maybe there is an Evernote for Dummies that I should read? ','?'
'id: 6085 ',' But please bring back the old search bar on top! ','?'
'id: 6088 ',' I love being able to find what I need when I need it. ','?'
'id: 6091 ',' But on the last few iPhone versions it just gets stuck scrolling down *every key I type*! ','?'
'id: 6091 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 6091 ',' It  s an obvious show stopper bug that needs your attention. ','?'
'id: 6098 ',' \\n\\nHighly recommend this app would love to see some of these issues improved. ','?'
'id: 6099 ',' In college we need to write mathematical formulas. ','?'
'id: 6099 ',' U need to do that from within the app rather than switching to penultimate. ','?'
'id: 6099 ',' \\n\\nAnd file manager needs to be more computer like and have better drag and drop integration. ','?'
'id: 6099 ',' They are several ways for improvements and this app definitely  needs to improve  but still at this stage is best in app store so far. ','?'
'id: 6101 ',' \\n\\nI did find that if you scroll then hold one finger down you can type with the other hand. ','?'
'id: 6102 ',' Easy camera function allows for adding recipes right to notebook. ','?'
'id: 6110 ',' It just has a few bugs on mobile related to bulleted and indented lists that are keeping me from giving it a five star rating, but I  m still a big fan of Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6114 ',' I  m not sure if it is Evernote or Apple but would love to see that fixed since I don  t have constant access to my PC and half the point of the app is to help me remember things that I would normally forget to do. ','?'
'id: 6118 ',' Ive never had a problem with it in the last 2 years, and have hundreds of notes. ','?'
'id: 6121 ',' 4 23 12 ,  I wish you could change font, including size among other things. ','?'
'id: 6135 ',' It helps me manage tons of things I need to remember, and file for future reference. ','?'
'id: 6135 ',' I would just like to see page capturing moved into Evernote itself instead of an additional AAP. ','?'
'id: 6136 ',' \\n\\nI would love to see an add on that is a shopping list program/routine that competes with SplashShopper and others like it. ','?'
'id: 6139 ',' I never forget to do something now. ','?'
'id: 6142 ',' Current version crashes endlessly. ','?'
'id: 6145 ',' Having handy notes when I need them wherever I am. ','?'
'id: 6149 ',' I was looking for a digital solution to keep me organized as I transitioned from a tree killing paper loving machine, to a paperless remote worker with no office. ','?'
'id: 6149 ',' I  ve been using the basic service for about 6 weeks and went from just trying it to using it daily across devices (MacBook, iPad, and iPhone). ','?'
'id: 6150 ',' This app has saved me so much where that STUPID note program that came with my ipad/iPhone as FAILED me REPEATEDLY!!! ','?'
'id: 6152 ',' This app, along with its sister apps like Skitch and Penultimate, provides a user with a host of tools that can serve a variety of needs with a variety of needs. ','?'
'id: 6155 ',' I need to keep track of notes and pictures and misc. ','?'
'id: 6157 ',' Highly recommend this to anyone looking to get more organized and productive. ','?'
'id: 6158 ',' Knock on wood I  ve never had any problems. ','?'
'id: 6161 ',' Would like to see better iOS accommodation of pasting iWorks docs into existing Notes, instead of just creating new ones. ','?'

'id: 6162 ',' Please, fix all the bugs on time. ','?'
'id: 6167 ',' Great app, however it would be nice to have multiple colors for the folders. ','?'
'id: 6173 ',' Since using Evernote I  ve had no problems with my notes staying put, but I  m low maintenance. ','?'

'id: 6177 ',' Evernote is the solution and with all the add on apps I am incredibly organized and connecting my office and friends with a group of incredibly powerful organizational  tools all based around Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6181 ',' I now use Evernote on the iPad for just about every list I need to make. ','?'
'id: 6184 ',' \\n\\nNo more numerous loose slips of paper that encumber me, nor the various notebooks that are never around when you really need them. ','?'
'id: 6184 ',' Would be nice to be able to simply tap on a link within the note. ','?'

'id: 6195 ',' The iPad app needs some work, so please keep up the enhancements / upgrades to the app for us Premium Customers...the more the iPad app mirrors the Laptop functionality, the better it gets. ','?'
'id: 6196 ',' You just have to start using it, and it is very easy. ','?'
'id: 6200 ',' The alphabetical order really screws me up since I need different titles of notes in class grouped together, and the date worked on makes the notes constantly move around since you are always working on them! ','?'
'id: 6200 ',' There are just some interface problems with uploading, copying and pasting PDFs or certain images onto the same note...makes it so I need to make 3 different notes for different menu options when I really want them all on one note. ','?'
'id: 6208 ',' With my iMac in the U.S., I can sit in a cafe in Barcelona, update Evernote on my iPad, watch the sync to my iPhone, then remote into the iMac and see the changes on my desktop. ','?'

'id: 6216 ',' I have not had too many problems with the new interface. ','?'
'id: 6219 ',' I don  t know if it has the option to change colors on the font or when creating a check list but that would be nice to have!!!! ','?'
'id: 6222 ',' The OCR feature has become one of those things that you just can  t live without. ','?'
'id: 6226 ',' I think the UI could be designed or laid out better to make things more intuitive and appealing to the eye\\n\\n  Formating notes: there are some quirks with the bullet point feature that adds a blank line before the bullet points. ','?'
'id: 6226 ',' \\n\\n  Check boxes:  The check box feature is useless. ','?'
'id: 6226 ',' There is no way to track where you have check boxes throughout all of your notes. ','?'

'id: 6239 ',' Very easy to learn how to do everything. ','?'
'id: 6239 ',' I don  t like that that I can  t change highlighter color to something better than weird orange and I don  t like that I can  t change the size of font in my notebook documents past the paragraph presets. ','?'
'id: 6247 ',' Evernote is intuitive, adaptive and a big help for anyone who needs access to now notes "from the road". ','?'
'id: 6257 ',' I really needed this. ','?'
'id: 6263 ',' I can  t annotate them in app, I have to use Skitch, which is sloppy and slow. ','?'
'id: 6263 ',' Also, I can  t consolidate two notes into one, which has caused me to use a different app for my Physics class, which requires a lot of work with separate pages of PDFs. ','?'
'id: 6263 ',' For me to rely on Evernote like I was expecting to, this must be remedied. ','?'

'id: 6321 ',' It is also a backup that ensures my notes aren  t lost if my laptop crashes. ','?'
'id: 6321 ',' \\n\\nThe desktop application is much more robust than the iPad app, but together they help me feel confident I have what I need with me at all times. ','?'
'id: 6325 ',' Using it for class and maybe I don  t know how to use it but its annoying that I can scroll or  see what I am typing at the end of the page. ','?'
'id: 6326 ',' But sometimes I wish I could have them a little more integrated. ','?'
'id: 6330 ',' Before the update everything worked fine but now whenever I go to use the page camera or even the regular camera the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 6330 ',' Please fix this   this is one of the most important parts of Evernote to me. ','?'
'id: 6333 ',' I also realized that when you start numbering your content, you kind of have to keep going and not have a paragraph in between. ','?'
'id: 6333 ',' Also, I think it would be really fun if you incorporate a doodling function in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6333 ',' What do you say? ','?'
'id: 6334 ',' It  s quite amazing and I  m sure there are ways I could be using it that I simply haven  t heard about or figured out yet. ','?'
'id: 6335 ',' I also can add pictures to their own personal Notebook. ','?'
'id: 6346 ',' My only issue is the value for subscribers to get sync. ','?'
'id: 6346 ',' I would also like to see annual discounts. ','?'
'id: 6357 ',' The app works amazingly; no random crashes and is just wonderfully organized! ','?'
'id: 6358 ',' I use it to prepare my flashcards to Evernote peek, i save web pages to look up later, and pretty much anything else I can use it for. ','?'
'id: 6361 ',' In what ought to be a no brainer for evernote, entering a note is the slowest of all...you wait for the cursor to appear, the text defaults to being small, it does not scroll well, selecting a different part of the text means waiting on the cursor again. ','?'
'id: 6364 ',' How did I live without it? ','?'
'id: 6370 ',' I have in on all my apple devices, except for my phone because you have to be online in order for it to work there. ','?'
'id: 6370 ',' my only issues with it are: the awkward printing format and how it requires you to be online to use it on your iPhone. ','?'
'id: 6375 ',' It  s not working many times. ','?'
'id: 6380 ',' Everything is searchable so I don  t need to remember where I filed it. ','?'
'id: 6382 ',' It  s all right here. ','?'
'id: 6384 ',' But one thing that would be helpful would be an auto sync whenever you close the app so if I don  t have my phone and need to access my notes, I can from a computer even if I forget to sync it. ','?'
'id: 6386 ',' I love that you can insert pics and save PDFs. ','?'
'id: 6386 ',' \\n\\nOne complaint is that you cannot add a PDF or journal article to a note that already exists, a separate note is created instead. ','?'
'id: 6388 ',' Cannot seem to figure out how to do Stack management (add, delete, rename). ','?'
'id: 6394 ',' If you have picture notes and you  re not near wifi or have poor signal, you will not be able to access them. ','?'
'id: 6398 ',' In 38 months of Evernote use, I have created more than 100 notes/month on average. ','?'
'id: 6399 ',' I do not have the scrolling problems that other reviews have complained about at all. ','?'
'id: 6400 ',' I found the notes app appallingly inadequate and frustrating for what I needed from it. ','?'
'id: 6402 ',' This one lets me do most things that I need to without the full desktop version, but I hope copying note links and a better "switch user" function is available in later releases. ','?'
'id: 6403 ',' I do not love how it constantly crashes and I never hear from customer support. ','?'
'id: 6406 ',' If you could only have 3 apps, Evernote should be one of them. ','?'
'id: 6406 ',' Salvation for those of us who used to be always looking for that piece of paper we needed!! ','?'
'id: 6411 ',' Just recently I got a MacBook Pro and to my surprise OneNote did not work on a Mac. ','?'
'id: 6411 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 6420 ',' \\n\\nFinally, I constantly receive alerts that the synchronization has failed. ','?'
'id: 6423 ',' I can create a work note while mobile or our of the office and consume the note in the office or visa versa. ','?'
'id: 6427 ',' I have been using this app for a very long time but now when I open the app on my iPad it crashes as it attempts to update. ','?'
'id: 6428 ',' But with Evernote, everything I needed to document was now easy to find and without clutter. ','?'
'id: 6429 ',' This is a good note taking program but it would be nice if landscape mode filled the whole screen. ','?'
'id: 6431 ',' This product needs rich text among other enhancements. ','?'
'id: 6444 ',' Also when I try to type notes it scrolls down ? ','?'
'id: 6445 ',' Literally what I want from a note taking app, just get it , ','?'
'id: 6447 ',' \\n\\nThe main area where it could be improved is in the formatting. ','?'
'id: 6447 ',' I occasionally have issues with bullet points when I have long lists with lots of indentions, copying/pasting within bulleted lists/outlines, and most frustratingly when a note is emailed out of Evernote additional, blank bullet points often appear (which then need to be manually removed before forwarding it on). ','?'
'id: 6449 ',' \\n\\nThe 1 BIG, BIG, BIG feature that  s missing is the ability to easily re order items in my task lists. ','?'
'id: 6449 ',' Add that &amp; I  ll update my rating. ','?'
'id: 6449 ',' \\n\\nAlso love the Skitch integration but it could be better (like adding a button or icon to include image from Skitch). ','?'
'id: 6449 ',' \\n\\nBesides the fact that most font &amp; style formatting goes out the window between Mac &amp; PC (this has always been an cross platform issue, not just an Evernote issue), syncing notes between all my devices (mobile, desktop, Mac &amp; PC) works flawlessly, which makes me very happy. ','?'
'id: 6464 ',' I  d like to see some trunk features available for integration. ','?'
'id: 6466 ',' \\n\\nI do hope that multi level numeric bulleted items will be fixed in the next update. ','?'
'id: 6470 ',' I  d appreciate if that could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 6472 ',' Perfect for college, I can get all my notes whether I  m on my iPad or computer and on those rough days where I forget everything I can at least get them on my phone lol , ','?'
'id: 6476 ',' But lately it  s been useless because Everytime I tried to update something from my phone it sends me to the button of the list. ','?'
'id: 6477 ',' Evernote wants to be your second brain, dump anything you need to remember here and have it at your fingertips when you need it. ','?'
'id: 6477 ',' I use the app on my phone, my laptop, my iPad, and on the web / whatever situation I  m in, I know I have the information I need. ','?'
'id: 6484 ',' I haven  t yet figured out how to delete old notes (are they there forever? ','?'
'id: 6484 ',' Is that why its called Evernote? ','?'
'id: 6484 ',' Also can  t figure out how to make a checklist even though I glanced at a tutorial. ','?'
'id: 6484 ',' It shouldn  t require that many steps! ','?'
'id: 6486 ',' If anyone knows the answer I would love to know. ','?'
'id: 6487 ',' Rapidcoe ,  Items should have optionally references to People. ','?'
'id: 6487 ',' Therefore, the ability to bring down google contacts and link the items in Evernote to those records would be very useful\\n\\nOn the ipad, the ability to move items between note books should be made easier. ','?'
'id: 6487 ',' Most of the times items completed would need to be archived or rescheduled instead of being deleted. ','?'
'id: 6490 ',' Consolidating in to Evernote has made a huge difference. ','?'
'id: 6492 ',' Overall app design is "fancy" but it FAILS at the one thing it  s supposed to be great at   note taking. ','?'
'id: 6496 ',' Once you know how to use it you can organize your whole life with it you can use it to replace the file cabinet if you wish. ','?'
'id: 6505 ',' s Garden ,  I use it for my job, it had made my tasks  a lot simpler, and a lot easier for me. ','?'
'id: 6506 ',' Stmsbabyj ,  It  s the best note taking app I ever used\\nWho ever made this app needs an award. ','?'
'id: 6507 ',' Why does the Evernote search not work on the titles I have given? ','?'
'id: 6508 ',' I recommend this ap. ','?'
'id: 6510 ',' Great app but need to fix some bugs , ','?'
'id: 6512 ',' I love the fact that you can access both on i devices and the web, and also save "favorites" on the iPhone for viewing offline. ','?'
'id: 6513 ',' Would like to see constant updates and very innovative features added. ','?'
'id: 6516 ',' Might like it better if I actually knew how to optimize its use and they were helpful in making the info you need easily available. ','?'
'id: 6517 ',' \\n\\nUI fail. ','?'
'id: 6518 ',' The new update crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 6523 ',' I  m just learning how to use Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6523 ',' Another alternate function might be to provide a mode that requires two separate keys to delete something. ','?'
'id: 6526 ',' Yes, you have to create an account and password but that  s what makes it so much better than a notebook. ','?'
'id: 6526 ',' Any note I create on any one of my devices is synchronized to all other devices, instantly. ','?'
'id: 6526 ',' If you choose you can share notes with others, my wife and I use it to make up grocery lists. ','?'
'id: 6546 ',' I can also use it better than than paper records to retrieve old notes and references. ','?'
'id: 6549 ',' Please update the audio, just like the rest of the app. ','?'
'id: 6551 ',' I finally made the switch from using Notes to using Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6553 ',' 96 ,  I used to take all my notes in notebooks and I thought I  d switch it up this year. ','?'
'id: 6553 ',' It also syncs all your notes with other devices using the app which is perfect for me when I forget my iPad, I can just use my phone and I have everything there! ','?'
'id: 6557 ',' I use this app all the time and I would have to rethink my life if I didn  t have it. ','?'
'id: 6560 ',' I love that its organized...totally recommend it! ','?'
'id: 6561 ',' I use it to organize my class notes and have had no problem using it on multiple devices. ','?'
'id: 6562 ',' between the desktop and the mobile version merely reflect how one would use a phone versus a computer. ','?'
'id: 6563 ',' I used Evernote to plan an upcoming trip to London and Croatia. ','?'
'id: 6564 ',' I would like Evernote to have a To Do feature with reminders and Push Notifications. ','?'
'id: 6568 ',' If I could create a folder AND place it in a stack on my iPad this would be a 5 rating. ','?'
'id: 6568 ',' I had issues with one note copying itself about 50 times, but customer service was excellent and helped me resolve it on all devices. ','?'
'id: 6568 ',' Otherwise, it is so easy to document everything that I need to in today  s crazy business environment. ','?'
'id: 6573 ',' \\n\\nMy beefs: I would love to see at least one more level of Stacks. ','?'
'id: 6575 ',' Use it to help me keep tabs on things I need to take action on or follow up. ','?'
'id: 6578 ',' has everything I need in a journal. ','?'
'id: 6593 ',' based on the article it usually even recommends the correct folder. ','?'
'id: 6602 ',' I can put all I need to know in Evernote and access it from anywhere. ','?'
'id: 6602 ',' What else needs to be said?! ','?'
'id: 6608 ',' I know that Evernote already supports wechat share function on your Chinese version, pls do on the international version too. ','?'
'id: 6611 ',' The only issue  which isn  t really an issue to me  is that the start up time is a tad bit longer than you would expect. ','?'
'id: 6614 ',' Install it, use it as heavily as you are comfortable doing, upgrade to premium when you are ready, and scare yourself with how much stuff you can keep track of. ','?'
'id: 6617 ',' While downloading this app several months ago I questioned whether I would use it or not. ','?'
'id: 6617 ',' \\n\\nThe potential here is awesome. ','?'
'id: 6618 ',' Would love it if notes could be annotated through Penultimate. ','?'
'id: 6620 ',' Synchronizing with Desktop CAN be a problem. ','?'

'id: 6633 ',' Lucky HBS taught us how to use. ','?'
'id: 6635 ',' Also, there is an issue with switching between the keyboard/text formatting tools. ','?'
'id: 6635 ',' You have to click in ad out of the text boxes and/or toggle between the two tools to make it finally pop up. ','?'
'id: 6636 ',' I don  t know how I made it before without Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6636 ',' I couldn  t recommend this any more than to say download it now. ','?'
'id: 6638 ',' I need my notes safe, even from me. ','?'
'id: 6640 ',' Title says it all: the "page camera" was a handy tool for getting paper documents into Evernote, but in this update it just crashes the app , ','?'
'id: 6641 ',' I highly recommend using it , ','?'
'id: 6645 ',' Og hood nikka ,  Evernote works great but the biggest problem is that you can  t send your notes to people through email which is a huge problem for me with having to send my notes, essays, and projects to my teachers. ','?'
'id: 6648 ',' How many apps can you say THAT about? ','?'
'id: 6648 ',' Bt yeah, the perfect depository for almost any and everything I need to remember. ','?'
'id: 6649 ',' It just makes life simpler. ','?'
'id: 6650 ',' Now I cannot edit a note and it locks up and crashes every time I try to use it. ','?'
'id: 6650 ',' Hope they can get this issue fixed. ','?'
'id: 6651 ',' I have come to depend on it for just about everything I need to keep organized. ','?'
'id: 6655 ',' I fail to see what everyone is talking about. ','?'
'id: 6656 ',' \\n\\nI started with just my stuff at work but eventually I saw the true benefit and now it  s my brain that doesn  t forget anything. ','?'
'id: 6656 ',' \\n\\nWhen inspiration strikes I can log it and forget it because I know it  s on my Mac, pc and phone. ','?'
'id: 6661 ',' \\n\\nMy only critique is not being able to organize tags within tags in the iPhone and iPad interfaces. ','?'
'id: 6664 ',' I don  t have to think if something is important enough to save. ','?'
'id: 6664 ',' I just save it even if it is just a word or two. ','?'
'id: 6667 ',' I just love it. ','?'
'id: 6670 ',' It would be nice to be able to use it again. ','?'
'id: 6670 ',' If it doesn  t hurry and get fixed I  m afraid I  ll have to switch to something else that will at least work. ','?'
'id: 6671 ',' It has made life soooo much easier! ','?'
'id: 6681 ',' \\n\\nThis is what MSFT one note is missing. ','?'
'id: 6681 ',' Ideas and thoughts come to me at all times and I need to be able to capture them at thar moment and in the correct tab, otherwise ill forget. ','?'
'id: 6682 ',' I became a premium user so that I could have access to notes offline. ','?'
'id: 6684 ',' I have the same issues with the new interface and the scrolling. ','?'
'id: 6684 ',' This app has lots of potential and to be fair people need to take the video training before crucifying it in a review. ','?'
'id: 6684 ',' I have had lots problems switching from photo to note mode. ','?'
'id: 6684 ',' As a plant breeder I am taking notes and lots of pictures at a fairly rapid pace and interface issues are not my friend. ','?'
'id: 6684 ',' Thus the videos need to be taken and you need to practice. ','?'
'id: 6690 ',' My whole life is in here which is great because wherever I go, I have all the important information I need with me. ','?'
'id: 6695 ',' I came back to this after rereading the reviews and told myself I need to seriously give this a try. ','?'
'id: 6695 ',' \\n\\nWow, I have been missing out. ','?'
'id: 6695 ',' I highly recommend them. ','?'
'id: 6698 ',' Great app, but better if some of the features on the web/desk client were available on the app. ','?'
'id: 6699 ',' The way the notes can be organized is clean, logical, and uncluttered. ','?'
'id: 6699 ',' I have and would recommend this App to anyone who needs to organize data in a clear, concise, and logical manner. ','?'
'id: 6701 ',' Otherwise, I really like how you can bullet, bold, and it  s great for notes! ','?'
'id: 6704 ',' \\n\\nIt  s had some bugs but keeps getting better. ','?'
'id: 6707 ',' I can use it across all of my devices so that my To Do list and my shopping list are always handy to update and use. ','?'
'id: 6712 ',' Also, Evernote sometimes takes longer to update between devices than I  d like and requires me to relaunch it from my phone. ','?'
'id: 6713 ',' This app is good for organizing any task that needs to be handled. ','?'
'id: 6714 ',' What happened that I can no longer resize an image? ','?'
'id: 6717 ',' Would be nice to have the PC app features available in IOS app. ','?'

'id: 6726 ',' But there is a new bug in which the app scrolls down a line every time I type a character. ','?'
'id: 6726 ',' Was trying to use this for note taking at a conference this week but I have to find another solution until this gets fixed. ','?'
'id: 6728 ',' I don  t just mean the iPhone or iPad versions, but rather the entire concept. ','?'
'id: 6733 ',' If anything could be improved I would ask that the picture capabilities  be enhanced so it could zoom. ','?'
'id: 6734 ',' Since the latest update, it just crashes every 10 seconds. ','?'
'id: 6739 ',' Think there is some bugs here and there. ','?'
'id: 6746 ',' I highly recommend it, specially for the GTD users. ','?'
'id: 6748 ',' I love this app, it  s useful, user friendly and very intuitive, all notes are available everywhere and supports all kinds of rich texts and files. ','?'
'id: 6752 ',' \\n\\nI second the request for multiple select in the mobile app   I often need to deal with multiple notes at once and right now it takes about a million taps for each note. ','?'
'id: 6762 ',' You just need to decide how you will use it to make it useful to you. ','?'
'id: 6767 ',' \\n\\n3) Evernote has numerous formatting issues that are all bizarre and maddening. ','?'
'id: 6767 ',' It  s just glitchy software here. ','?'
'id: 6767 ',' How can things like font and line spacing corrupt your files? ','?'
'id: 6769 ',' \\n\\nI just purchased a Scansnap 1300i and it integrates with Evernote. ','?'
'id: 6772 ',' Whenever I come across something I want to remember, a picture, object, note, article, or thought, I quickly open up Evernote, drop it in a notebook, and it  s there anytime I need it. ','?'
'id: 6772 ',' Even if I don  t put it in a notebook at the time, I can create one later but the note is always there. ','?'
'id: 6773 ',' I hate the word paradigm, but using this did require some shift in my paradigm of how to track info. ','?'
'id: 6776 ',' Please fix asap so that this is useful for taking notes in long meetings again. ','?'
'id: 6792 ',' It  s exactly what it  s supposed to be, simple, easy to use, and available on all of my iPhones, iPads, iPods, and my iMac. ','?'
'id: 6799 ',' The best app for people like me whom constantly need to find quickly an information. ','?'
'id: 6803 ',' If your looking for an app that does it all, Evernote needs to be on your top list. ','?'
'id: 6804 ',' It failed my test. ','?'
'id: 6804 ',' Items I plan to use many times a day must be carefully thought out to make the interface intuitive &amp; not like product packaging that takes a cutting torch &amp; a grinder to open. ','?'
'id: 6804 ',' A 5 year old can run an iPad. ','?'
'id: 6805 ',' But I  m afraid I must give it a bit of a low ranking because for years, they have never been able to get formatting right. ','?'
'id: 6805 ',' \\n\\nAlso, "shortcut notes" or "clone notes" that sync with each other would be nice to have....the ability to effectively have a note in more than one folder. ','?'
'id: 6810 ',' Just learning the ins and outs. ','?'
'id: 6810 ',' Is there some online help for beginners? ','?'
'id: 6814 ',' Flexibility, device agnostic, seamless sync, data available everywhere. ','?'
'id: 6820 ',' I really like Evernote, but with this new update the app instantly crashes after it opens. ','?'
'id: 6822 ',' However every time I open it now the app crashes on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 6823 ',' Just wish they also had the ability to create and save simple spreadsheets tables, then everything I need and use will all be on Evernote! ','?'
'id: 6829 ',' The layout is intuitive and simple and the product never crashes and always is on sync amongst my multiple devices. ','?'
'id: 6830 ',' Please fix audio recording. ','?'

'id: 6844 ',' We track virtually everything, and find anything we need quickly. ','?'
'id: 6844 ',' I find myself looking forward to updates to see what they  ve added each time! ','?'

'id: 6866 ',' I highly recommend this note app. ','?'
'id: 6868 ',' I don  t recommend installing this version. ','?'
'id: 6869 ',' I frequently have brilliant ideas that must be written down immediately, before the idea, or turn of phrase fades. ','?'
'id: 6869 ',' Another good thing about evernote is that it has an API that means other applications can use evernote. ','?'
'id: 6869 ',' For example There is a journal app that you write little notes on throughout the day, and it makes a single note in evernote that has the time (and maybe location) of each of your notes (I just looked it up its called vjournal). ','?'
'id: 6871 ',' Now, with the new update it crashes when I try to open a note. ','?'
'id: 6873 ',' I love that I can create different notebooks and keep my notes organized. ','?'
'id: 6874 ',' If I have to mess around   learning   how to use an app, then it  s not doing it  s job. ','?'

'id: 6911 ',' My life before Evernote was chaos, filled with things I would forget about, deadlines passed, and trips to the store without my list. ','?'
'id: 6911 ',' If you dont use this app or are thinking about using it, just do it! ','?'
'id: 6915 ',' This app made my to do list and note taking greatly more efficient, organized and accessible. ','?'
'id: 6919 ',' I shouldn  t have to pay a monthly fee to sync to my phone so they  re available offline. ','?'
'id: 6920 ',' Some surprisingly counter intuitive usability issues:\\n\\nIf i multitask to a different app and come back to evernote, I lose the note I was working on / reading, the title screen loads again and I have to navigate back to my note. ','?'
'id: 6922 ',' It is rock steady   I know it will be there whenever I need it. ','?'
'id: 6930 ',' Another bug is that Evernote sometimes randomly changes the formatting of the sentence as I  m typing if I used multiple formattings in the document. ','?'
'id: 6930 ',' I  m still having the same problems after multiple evernote "updates"  \\n\\nI can  t even see what I  m typing because the screen keeps jumping away!!!! ','?'
'id: 6931 ',' The one thing I really need a note editor to do well is to be able to type and edit text   in a moderately useful way. ','?'

'id: 6931 ',' I can  t paste text consistently or paste text in the title section. ','?'

'id: 6949 ',' This is the only one you need. ','?'
'id: 6951 ',' At the moment, you can  t copy/paste text, many users (myself included) have reported a typing bug where the cursor jumps when you try to type, rendering the note taking part useless. ','?'
'id: 6951 ',' I personally think it should be easier to manage your Evernote on a phone without accessing a computer. ','?'
'id: 6958 ',' If you added a handwriting feature it would eliminate this problem and better extend the potential this app has. ','?'

'id: 6969 ',' I  ve been happy with it, and the thing I like most about it is I can use it on my iPad or access my notes via any web browser. ','?'
'id: 6969 ',' I would love to see a feature when I could create a task from the notes  example action items from the meeting. ','?'
'id: 6981 ',' Everyone should have it and learn to apply it in their lives. ','?'
'id: 6989 ',' For some reason mines no longer checks for spelling you can  t adjust the font color or size, your not able to highlight documents there is no way to correct something , ','?'
'id: 6990 ',' I just keep everything here. ','?'
'id: 7004 ',' I  ll try again after an update becomes available but until then this app is unusable. ','?'
'id: 7005 ',' There could be improvements on being able to organize it the way you want or be able to customize it  but all mac/ios based systems/computers/software/apps seem to have that issue for me. ','?'
'id: 7005 ',' It is wonderful to be able to have it available to use on multiple platforms because BEFORE smart phones i had sketchbooks and backpocket sized steno pads etc and i was spending WAYYYY tooo much time trying to consolidate them all to one place and keep it organized. ','?'
'id: 7014 ',' If you need to store lots of information and then be able to retrieve it through a number of different tags, you  ll love Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7016 ',' However, skeptic in me is becoming more and more paranoid as now the big brother only needs to crack one app to get everything that all the smart people are doing. ','?'
'id: 7017 ',' Love the multiple notebooks, the ease of adding pics or audio. ','?'
'id: 7024 ',' I used to use this app a lot for sharing between the pcs and macs and ipad, and for the last 2 months the app has failed to update, despite numerous uninstalls, reinstalls. ','?'
'id: 7024 ',' How could this be? ','?'
'id: 7036 ',' The ONLY problem I have with Evernote is that it either lets you bold, underline or highlight with orange a word or line. ','?'
'id: 7043 ',' I use it daily to take notes but I wish I could use it to create documents ready to print or send but it needs more little important functions to format. ','?'
'id: 7044 ',' I would prefer a true To Do List (perhaps in a separate section) without having to create separate notes for each item and adding reminders. ','?'
'id: 7046 ',' Also password protection please would be very nice considering all our lives are on this app. ','?'
'id: 7050 ',' Only problem is sometimes keystrokes enter more then once and spellcheck is intermittent. ','?'
'id: 7053 ',' And when we get back to our computers, everything is available. ','?'
'id: 7054 ',' It then told me I needed to change it. ','?'
'id: 7056 ',' I track to do lists, house listings, everything I need to do with reminders whenever necessary. ','?'
'id: 7057 ',' Great and recommend it single mindedly. ','?'
'id: 7060 ',' One of the cons &amp; I wish they would let me (or I need to figure out how to) upload more than one video per note as well as upload videos straight to the app instead of having to send the video through a message first. ','?'
'id: 7068 ',' Now that I understand it and have figured out how to tailor it to my needs, it  s absolutely phenomenal. ','?'
'id: 7070 ',' Everyone should use it. ','?'
'id: 7071 ',' I would highly suggest investing a few bucks and get one of the guides to help you get set up. ','?'
'id: 7075 ',' Thank you for all your efforts in making Evernote everyday and for making it easily available for everyone. ','?'
'id: 7077 ',' As far as I can tell you can  t do this. ','?'
'id: 7078 ',' Useful in so many ways, I can  t think of a mobile user without this app. ','?'
'id: 7079 ',' I stopped using Onenote because Evernote made information I was working on available on all my devises. ','?'
'id: 7079 ',' "It just works!!" ','?'
'id: 7079 ',' If you like to keep notes and would like to have them on all your devises, in a quick and easy way, you won  t go wrong by trying Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7080 ',' So I have all these important notes I need and can  t get to. ','?'
'id: 7086 ',' I have to think way too hard about how to find things   and sometimes I get lost. ','?'
'id: 7090 ',' Update: 8 09 2013\\nAlthough this had been my favorite app, just experienced a crash of one of my continuing notes in my notebook. ','?'
'id: 7090 ',' I updated the app one day, and the next day it only showed the note from the previous day. ','?'
'id: 7090 ',' \\n\\nNo longer do I need to carry a journal with me everywhere I go! ','?'
'id: 7094 ',' Highly recommend this app , ','?'
'id: 7096 ',' I have been using it for several months and love the ability to have all my data available on any device! ','?'
'id: 7100 ',' This app is great when you need to catagorize information in a way it can be accessed later. ','?'
'id: 7104 ',' I use this app all the time for work and personal use, definitely the best note taking app out there I recommend it to everyone I know. ','?'
'id: 7107 ',' I usually hesitate to update apps, because i have to get used to the new look/interface. ','?'
'id: 7107 ',' But every evernote update just makes it better than before. ','?'
'id: 7113 ',' Just ran the last update, but now I can  t type to change a note. ','?'
'id: 7113 ',' Please fix this ASAP!!! ','?'
'id: 7118 ',' I love taking notes on paper, but the reality of it is that I need to eventually type them up, and I need them all the time, anywhere I go. ','?'
'id: 7119 ',' With Evernote I am making a note for each folder and adding tags that describe what I am putting in. ','?'
'id: 7120 ',' I like this app however I  m very disappointed that a subscription is required just to get a passcode lock. ','?'
'id: 7123 ',' \\n\\nThe only problem is this: with the recent update which includes recent/related notes at the bottom, the note now snap scrolls so the footer bar (with reminder, star, skitch, and share) covers up the bottom line of text. ','?'
'id: 7123 ',' It  s a minor inconvenience, but an oversight which should be addressed regardless. ','?'
'id: 7125 ',' The latest release of this application is crashing on me constantly! ','?'
'id: 7126 ',' The only problem I have is that the app is no longer updating for my iOS. ','?'
'id: 7126 ',' Oh well at least I can still use my current version, for that you lose a star. ','?'
'id: 7131 ',' Clicking on share this notebook or the share button in the notebook brings me to a webview that just says "loading." ','?'
'id: 7140 ',' \\n\\nI have a future wish that PDF, Excel &amp; Word Documents files attachments could have a thumbnail preview prior to opening the file. ','?'
'id: 7147 ',' I  m disappointed that the iPad version of Evernote doesn  t allow me to do word counts, as I need it for work assignments. ','?'
'id: 7150 ',' I just open a new note every day &amp; keep a log of all thats gone on   the tags are so helpful! ','?'
'id: 7158 ',' Easy way to organize all your files and capture anything you need. ','?'
'id: 7158 ',' Removing from multitask screen and reboot does not work. ','?'
'id: 7163 ',' I  m able to capture all the information I need on multiple platforms. ','?'
'id: 7165 ',' 2 updates on and it still crashes. ','?'
'id: 7166 ',' I haven  t had any problems with it so far. ','?'
'id: 7169 ',' They keep adding cool features and I keep using it more and more! ','?'
'id: 7174 ',' Please fix the spell check word replacement, spaces that I typed keep disappearing when I choose a word to replace. ','?'
'id: 7174 ',' :/ That needs to change. ','?'
'id: 7174 ',' Please either add this feature or explain that it is in the Premium version. ','?'
'id: 7175 ',' I have never had A problem with losing data. ','?'
'id: 7175 ',' I don  t know why the new reminder function won  t work on the windows desktop where I need it. ','?'
'id: 7175 ',' Which I don  t plan to do. ','?'
'id: 7175 ',' Please don  t sell out and get trashed by a new owner. ','?'
'id: 7177 ',' I keep track of recipes so if I  m in the store and forgot and ingredients I can look up the recipe in my Evernote notebook and see what I need. ','?'
'id: 7177 ',' If I  m shopping and I  ve made notations about dimensions needed for a purchase I can open up my Evernote on my iPhone and get the information I need. ','?'
'id: 7182 ',' I even send email content , including ppt, excel, etc...directly from Outlook to Evernote for easy referencing regardless if I am on my PC, iPhone, Droid, or iPad  \\n\\nKeep adding enhancements   Love it!!! ','?'
'id: 7184 ',' Evernote, please please please release the next Windows version that includes the reminders soon! ','?'
'id: 7189 ',' \\n* Although GDocs can do a lot of what Evernote does, I find Evernote does things like uploading images (super quick on the desktop   just drag and drop) and really easy with the iOS app (just snap one or more pictures and then press the checkmark when you  re done) well. ','?'
'id: 7189 ',' You have the option with the iOS app to save photos as "small"   it shows up okay and actually when you share a note, it looks better than saving as "large". ','?'
'id: 7189 ',' In that case it just saves two versions of your note and you have to figure out which you want later. ','?'
'id: 7195 ',' I downloaded Evernote to replace my Catch note app and it  s ridiculous that I need wifi to see notes I WROTE. ','?'
'id: 7196 ',' Clunky and crashes when taking photos. ','?'
'id: 7196 ',' I expect a smoother app for something I pay yearly for. ','?'
'id: 7201 ',' An idea is that I would like to have some notebooks in one bigger notebook. ','?'
'id: 7202 ',' I have always been a huge Evernote fan but after the last update I am having trouble with freezing and crashing. ','?'
'id: 7202 ',' I tried to add a shortcut and it just says loading and now won  t come undone. ','?'
'id: 7202 ',' Deleting and downloading again but please fix this, I would hate to lose such a useful app! ','?'
'id: 7203 ',' I love this app because if I accidentally forget my notes at school, I have them on my iPad at home and I can get my homework done easily. ','?'
'id: 7212 ',' I can  t function without Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7214 ',' I don  t even use binders for school anymore, I just take pictures of the worksheets and put them in a note so that I always have the information from all my classes in my pocket that I can access like anywhere. ','?'
'id: 7219 ',' I use it every day and it  s especially useful for someone like me who has ADD and forgets everything! ','?'
'id: 7220 ',' How did I ever live without it? ','?'
'id: 7220 ',' I used it for work   adding notes to different notebooks based on projects I was working on. ','?'
'id: 7222 ',' What makes this app so great is that you can create multiple notebooks to organize all the notes &amp; it syncs to your phone, laptop &amp; tablet automatically (as long as you can download the app to all the devices or access from the web). ','?'
'id: 7226 ',' What did I do before having Evernote available on every device, all the time? ','?'
'id: 7231 ',' Even my supermarket app updates my shopping list instantly  if I add something on my ipad, it  s there on my iPhone immediately. ','?'
'id: 7231 ',' What is the point of a note app that isn  t constantly saving and refreshing? ','?'
'id: 7231 ',' And this isn  t just the case over a few minutes   time; I  ve had notes not change over the course of weeks  I have to to go to the last device I made changes on, refresh, and then refresh again on the other device. ','?'
'id: 7234 ',' Only app I keep things I NEED to remember regardless of my location. ','?'
'id: 7238 ',' Coming from Catch notes (which sadly, is closing down) I just can  t help but feel Evernote is bloated, cumbersome, and, ironically, disorganized. ','?'
'id: 7238 ',' Not only is it annoying that to tag a note you have to open up a separate "info" page, but you can only search one tag at a time. ','?'
'id: 7238 ',' Evernote tries to do this automatically, but it fails. ','?'
'id: 7238 ',' It doesn  t, and can  t, understand what my reason for adding a note was. ','?'
'id: 7238 ',' An article may be titled "elephants" but I may have saved it for a mention of African geography. ','?'
'id: 7238 ',' This does not do that. ','?'
'id: 7245 ',' It provides all of the functionality I need. ','?'
'id: 7245 ',' As I switch between my iPad, phone and laptop throughout the day, the synchronization between the devices ensures I have the latest information and notes available for referencing. ','?'
'id: 7248 ',' It  s great however the one think I  d love is if they can allow to lock with pin. ','?'
'id: 7249 ',' Am I the only one whose evernote for iPad isn  t working right? ','?'
'id: 7253 ',' I already use Evernote instead of Apple Notes, but if there was a way to combine the calendar option is as well, Evernote would become the ultimate organizational app. ','?'
'id: 7258 ',' I think Evernote should stop making us take notes the way they design it. ','?'
'id: 7258 ',' I  m not saying stop adding new features but at least leave the old features available. ','?'
'id: 7261 ',' Please get this fixed soon! ','?'
'id: 7268 ',' Had a lot of trouble figuring out how to make image and document notes, but otherwise it gets the job done. ','?'
'id: 7269 ',' This is my favorite app, my go to app that I recommend to everyone. ','?'
'id: 7274 ',' I find the older I get the more I forget. ','?'
'id: 7276 ',' Please make the section for the ad of premium disappear. ','?'
'id: 7277 ',' It hasn  t added any dazzling feature in a while. ','?'
'id: 7277 ',' \\n\\nI like the app but I think it  s lost its innovative juice and needs to integrate more closely with its other apps to be more efficient. ','?'
'id: 7277 ',' It seems odd that I need to export images of notes in those apps to be able to use them in an Evernote note. ','?'
'id: 7277 ',' The images that are stored in their respective notebooks are useless because I need them in specific notes and notebooks. ','?'
'id: 7277 ',' \\n\\nIt would be nice to be able to format my notes with more than just basic rich text formatting. ','?'
'id: 7278 ',' The app runs smoothly, has a fairly intuitive design, and has fewer sync issues than the previous version. ','?'
'id: 7280 ',' Where I store all my musings and otherwise forgotten thoughts. ','?'
'id: 7281 ',' It crashes!!! ','?'
'id: 7281 ',' Please fix ASAP. ','?'
'id: 7283 ',' I take a picture of any handouts given at meetings, and upload them into the note I made during the meeting, tag into the appropriate notebook, and bam. ','?'
'id: 7293 ',' And I like how I can use it even when I  m offline, a wonderful feature. ','?'
'id: 7295 ',' Lacks the ability to select multiple images when adding them to a note. ','?'
'id: 7298 ',' They need to make the ability to change the background. ','?'
'id: 7314 ',' It would be nice to have the ability to change only a letter in stead of a whole word. ','?'
'id: 7316 ',' Fastest way to get a new note in is always email. ','?'
'id: 7320 ',' The added security provides a lot more comfort when the kids are using the phone for one of their apps. ','?'
'id: 7322 ',' I highly recommend this app to anyone on the line , ','?'
'id: 7325 ',' I can create notes fast and the options to format the text are easy and effective. ','?'
'id: 7327 ',' My only problem is that 60 MG is not enough upload space. ','?'
'id: 7329 ',' I would not be able to do anything without Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7332 ',' Adding a recurring option to reminders and an Apple Mail plug in would be good additions. ','?'
'id: 7336 ',' When I found out about this app I just loved it! ','?'
'id: 7338 ',' \\n\\nThe problem is I can  t then share the note with Facebook or twitter or anywhere else. ','?'
'id: 7338 ',' \\n\\nUntil the problems I listed above, which are just a couple of things I noticed immediately, are corrected I will not be able to use Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7340 ',' Just need to have better notifications alarms etc. , ','?'
'id: 7341 ',' I read a blog article about how you need to fully jump in and just use Evernote for everything you can possibly think of? ','?'
'id: 7341 ',' The synchronization between devices has made my life so much easier! ','?'
'id: 7342 ',' I love Evernote, I really do, but please fix the crashing right after launch! ','?'
'id: 7344 ',' \\n\\nThe offline notebook feature is great on my iPhone so that I have all the info I need, even if my phone can  t reach the network. ','?'
'id: 7348 ',' I love that everything is available everywhere, allowing me to capture anything. ','?'
'id: 7352 ',' Just downloaded the latest release, the text entry keyboard does not display and user is unable to enter text , ','?'
'id: 7353 ',' Please keep it forward! ','?'
'id: 7354 ',' If Penultimate was available for my Kindle Fire, I  d have all I need. ','?'
'id: 7358 ',' I paste my passwords I paste copies of receipts and anything that I need to locate later and I can easily find it in one location the search option is very handy as well. ','?'
'id: 7366 ',' Now I don  t need to do that any more because this fulfills all my needs. ','?'
'id: 7372 ',' I love this app, but after the last up date I cant pull up the key board, to type, please fix   I use this for everything , ','?'
'id: 7373 ',' This app is such a great thing for beginning writers like myself. ','?'
'id: 7373 ',' I recommend it completely. ','?'
'id: 7387 ',' I wish it synced more often and that work saved on one device wouldn  t automatically be saved over when it failed to sync. ','?'
'id: 7389 ',' So far Evernote has been the best note taker imho and the fact that I can use it across multiple platforms is great!! ','?'
'id: 7391 ',' Useful, helps me to plan my day and post reminders. ','?'
'id: 7395 ',' In my opinion, the only thing it  s missing is video handling. ','?'
'id: 7395 ',' You can add pictures and audio to your notes, and I think you should be able to add videos, too. ','?'
'id: 7397 ',' News Monitor ,  I tried this, just entered a simple note, but couldn  t edit the note! ','?'
'id: 7397 ',' I was only allowed to either keep adding things to the note, making it bigger and bigger, or delete and start over. ','?'
'id: 7398 ',' For the iPad I  d like to see something similar to TextExpander on the Mac where a couple of short hand characters could add multiple words. ','?'
'id: 7402 ',' \\n\\nWho  s idea was the "Shortcuts" idea and to install an intrusive "Star" which in app language, means favorites, at the bottom of the iPhone app, this is just creating changes, for changes sake. ','?'
'id: 7402 ',' I think someone is just trying to justify their job, but isn  t there a QC at Evernote to pass these changes off? ','?'
'id: 7403 ',' \\n\\nFor example, I keep forgetting how to do a screen capture on my iPhone. ','?'
'id: 7403 ',' Now I can locate this page quickly and easily, whenever I need it. ','?'
'id: 7405 ',' That means I end up with tons of notes and really need to clean it out more often, but that  s my problem, not theirs. ','?'
'id: 7406 ',' etter not update to the latest one, it will freeze or crash all the time. ','?'
'id: 7408 ',' You don  t just lead me on and then kill it off. ','?'
'id: 7408 ',' Someone at the company needs to stand up for the users. ','?'
'id: 7409 ',' The latest update added a lot of stupid features, they have to make it optional at least\\n\\nI HATE when I reach to the bottom of any note and this list show up\\n\\nMAKE IT AN OPTION THAT I CAN TURN OFF IF I DON  T WANT IT\\n\\nif they didn  t fix this, I  ll cancel my account and delete evernote\\n\\nThere is a lot of other choices for me in the app store , ','?'
'id: 7410 ',' When I was creating trouble myself with uploading and lost a few of my notes, the staff were willing to compensate for the data, and they even gave me 3 months more of the premium to fall in love with the app again. ','?'
'id: 7411 ',' If a picture is taken in a series you can  t delete just one \\nBasic editing poor , ','?'
'id: 7415 ',' This ipad app and its iPhone sibling are not what I expect our of an evernote product. ','?'
'id: 7415 ',' Saved searches need to be easier to get to, and the app simply need to load faster. ','?'
'id: 7418 ',' its a good app but i think there should be daily reminders or just like the alarms that are already on the devices you can set the days . ','?'
'id: 7421 ',' The new user interface makes adding a note, and especially retrieving notes, very slow. ','?'
'id: 7422 ',' \\nIn the newest update, favourites have been removed, and replaced with   shortcuts. ','?'
'id: 7425 ',' Otherwise I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 7433 ',' I hope to find out all the other ways I can use it! ','?'
'id: 7437 ',' Only platform I don  t care for is app to use with Windows 8, but can just use web access there. ','?'
'id: 7442 ',' Use it for notes, receipts, paperwork i need to save, even taking photos of where I park. ','?'
'id: 7444 ',' Two additions to this app to make it just about perfect would be...one adding a lock/password/pass code feature to notebooks so students can  t get into each others notebooks being on one evernote account. ','?'
'id: 7444 ',' Two, adding the ability to edit (write/type) right on top of a picture/document you bring into a note (without having to go through Skitch). ','?'
'id: 7445 ',' You can only use the same 1, 2, 3 as sub bulletins, kind of stupid design. ','?'
'id: 7460 ',' Loved this application for a few weeks and now it  s having major issues with syncing. ','?'
'id: 7465 ',' I went from hauling a heavy book bag around with me to just carrying my purse to class! ','?'
'id: 7470 ',' It takes some figuring out how to integrate into your life flow but once you do it is one of the most often used utilities I own on any of my devices. ','?'
'id: 7474 ',' The new version crashes on startup. ','?'
'id: 7475 ',' My only petty complaint is that I wish it was  even more simple and clean, but other than that, I highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 7477 ',' If their servers ever fail and I lose everything I will kill myself. ','?'
'id: 7488 ',' I would like to see the ability to chose different text colors and different highlighter colors. ','?'
'id: 7493 ',' This is a great app for organizing information for work, I have made a notebook for all of my customers. ','?'
'id: 7505 ',' And it isn  t published to the web where you have to keep a filter on what you say. ','?'
'id: 7505 ',' Sometimes I like to have notebooks of just websites, and creating entire blank notes just for each site is both inefficient and hard to go through afterwards. ','?'
'id: 7506 ',' You can get around this by using the Drafts app (from Agile Tortoise) to create Evernote notes if you use TE snippets (e.g., date/time stamps, which are VERY helpful), but it would be even better if Evernote supported TE out of the box. ','?'
'id: 7510 ',' \\n\\nThe ease and ability to merge notes is a great tool. ','?'
'id: 7512 ',' I recommend this app to students or to anyone who needs to organize a mass of heterogenous information. ','?'
'id: 7517 ',' Does everything I need it to do. ','?'
'id: 7536 ',' Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing; trainings that are obvious to all but me. ','?'
'id: 7536 ',' I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use. ','?'
'id: 7542 ',' I highly recommend this App. ','?'
'id: 7543 ',' with that said I wish there was easier way to transfer info from Notes and merge or combine notes within program , ','?'
'id: 7552 ',' I recommend this to ANYONE. ','?'
'id: 7554 ',' I use it more than almost any other addon app on my iPhone and iPad and desktop and recommend it to everyone. ','?'
'id: 7557 ',' \\n\\nI know this is probably a stretch but it would be really nice if there was a way to create playlists in a note. ','?'
'id: 7558 ',' There are so many opportunities, I don  t think I  ve explored them all, but there are big things that you can do. ','?'
'id: 7565 ',' Evernote is my goto app for notes and my proxy memory so I don  t forget everything I need to do. ','?'
'id: 7566 ',' If you have Evernote, you need this app. ','?'
'id: 7573 ',' Only wish I could have more notes available a month, my fault I use too many! ','?'
'id: 7574 ',' This app has changed my life   I can record and organize so much info both personal and professional  will share it with as many people as I can  hope it never fails me! ','?'
'id: 7578 ',' The only problem with it is that it doesn  t have a feature to import notes from Apple  s note app, and when you have over 200 of notes it can get tedious to manually transfer them , ','?'
'id: 7587 ',' It has allowed me to stop printing stuff from the web to put in files and stop collecting piles of paper that need to be filed. ','?'
'id: 7591 ',' \\n\\nPage recognition camera should have multiple or resizing option for differing page sizes. ','?'
'id: 7592 ',' \\n\\nI also use my Evernote to store notes from meetings I attend, share important information with those who need access to the information. ','?'
'id: 7593 ',' Of course, there are a few issues; nothing is perfect. ','?'
'id: 7594 ',' I use Evernote constantly to quickly store info that is then searchable and available on all my devices. ','?'
'id: 7595 ',' Evernote had made it so simple to create, organize, and keep organized all sorts of things I need or want to remember. ','?'
'id: 7598 ',' You  d think they  d fix it by now. ','?'
'id: 7600 ',' It  s my go to whenever I need to jot a note down and I don  t have my notebook or journal. ','?'
'id: 7600 ',' \\n\\nAnd I love how you can organize your notes by creating different notebooks and you can tag your notes. ','?'
'id: 7603 ',' I don  t know how I made it this far w/o Evernote, but you are my "go to " app for . ','?'
'id: 7609 ',' \\n\\nYes you can do this through your emails, but this way is soo much cooler!?!? ','?'
'id: 7613 ',' Now my digital brain is even more accessible with the iPad app, adding huge value to the iPad. ','?'
'id: 7618 ',' I am still learning how to use it but it seems to have great flexibility. ','?'
'id: 7620 ',' \\n\\nLooking forward to learning how to integrate Skitch and Penultimate. ','?'
'id: 7621 ',' Synchronization constantly fails when I update or create a new note. ','?'
'id: 7621 ',' App constantly crashes. ','?'
'id: 7623 ',' A great system if you understand how to best use it. ','?'
'id: 7627 ',' \\n\\nStill needs a better random discovery feature. ','?'
'id: 7637 ',' Just download the app to your computer and portable device. ','?'
'id: 7639 ',' You can save all sorts of information to it and have a lot of flexibility on how to organize things. ','?'
'id: 7646 ',' To really reliably access this and save it across platforms when you are offline you need to upgrade to premium. ','?'
'id: 7648 ',' I have not been able to find good documentation or support. ','?'
'id: 7648 ',' My iPad often appears to hang and I cannot tell if problem is with WiFi network or on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 7649 ',' Reminders are very general so you need one note for each task instead of the placing different reminders inside one note. ','?'
'id: 7651 ',' Every time I remember that I want to remind myself of some, have a writing idea, a blog thought, etc, I grab Evernote and jot it down. ','?'
'id: 7659 ',' My one big disappointment is that I can  t work on a note if I don  t have signal. ','?'
'id: 7659 ',' Once I was working on a note in a place with iffy wi fi. ','?'
'id: 7659 ',' The other annoyance is not really being able to share notes. ','?'
'id: 7662 ',' \\n\\nAppreciate the Facebook posting as well, when I want to share a particularly funny story I just entered into Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7662 ',' \\n\\nWish that notes could be stored locally, so I didn  t have to find wifi access with my iPod. ','?'
'id: 7666 ',' Love it because I don  t have to duplicate effort when I get to office. ','?'
'id: 7669 ',' I think Evernote should make an agenda, that would be magnificent. ','?'
'id: 7670 ',' I recommend this app to everyone, because I  ve found numerous and diverse uses for it. ','?'
'id: 7677 ',' Does everything I need, I only wish I could mark notes as completed, and be able to filter uncomplete , ','?'
'id: 7681 ',' Helps me reduce the amount of paper I need to keep around. ','?'
'id: 7689 ',' Feels like you can bring your blog or personal diary everywhere! ','?'
'id: 7697 ',' wish that I could sync and share folders with people but that  s a paid service but it  s the best and that  s all that needs to be said. ','?'
'id: 7709 ',' I said that I understand that you don  t troubleshoot problems with such apps, but all I want is to find out how to contact the app provider because the app did not credit me with payment. ','?'
'id: 7710 ',' Some of the new upgrades have made this an app that is extremely valuable. ','?'
'id: 7710 ',' I have had no problem at all synching all my devices. ','?'
'id: 7710 ',' \\n\\nI teach women  s Bible Studies and I can prepare my lecture and all scripture and notes in a notebook. ','?'
'id: 7713 ',' That  s good, right? ','?'
'id: 7714 ',' I recently added Evernote to my iPad and laptop. ','?'
'id: 7721 ',' \\n\\nCreating notebooks is a bit cumbersome, especially adding sub notebooks. ','?'
'id: 7723 ',' I can use this practically everyday. ','?'
'id: 7727 ',' I use Evernote everyday and finding it to be amazingly useful since all of my notes are available on all of my devices. ','?'
'id: 7731 ',' But I like to align my writing to the center of the page, which you cannot do. ','?'
'id: 7734 ',' This is a wonderful app that enables users to write about whatever they need in a variety of ways on a variety of devices. ','?'
'id: 7738 ',' With all the modules that are available, image manipulation is seriously lacking and would be a welcomed addition. ','?'
'id: 7748 ',' I hate filing paper, but I like taking notes and my occupation requires access to a large amount of information when I  m not in the office. ','?'
'id: 7751 ',' It doesn  t Reverse the list as it does on the PC version, which is a problem when reaching 400+ computers using a numbering system, take many swipes to get to the next note from a fresh restart of the app. ','?'
'id: 7752 ',' I always have access to documents I need. ','?'
'id: 7757 ',' \\n\\nI just bought the Moleskine notebook, and I am confident it will be a great addition to my toolkit. ','?'
'id: 7760 ',' Had to create my own in a notebook which is not a problem, but the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 7761 ',' It would be nice if I could delete a notebook or category after I create it. ','?'
'id: 7761 ',' I don  t see how to do that. ','?'
'id: 7764 ',' But WHY is there no way to change font size? ','?'
'id: 7768 ',' The challenge was trying to find one place to go to with the different types of documents I wanted to have quickly available for reference in the future  sometimes at work but many times in another setting. ','?'
'id: 7771 ',' \\n\\nI have organized my notes by notebooks and every note is there when I need to refer back to it along with the date I last updated it. ','?'
'id: 7772 ',' Normally you have to use it for a while, so that you can really feel the convenience it really brings you. ','?'
'id: 7776 ',' Notes and todos update from where and what you need. ','?'
'id: 7777 ',' Nothing compares to Evernote available on all platforms and can keep pictures, ideas, travel plans, emails and more. ','?'
'id: 7777 ',' \\n\\nAs you start to add documents you don  t experience the power until you need to search for something. ','?'
'id: 7778 ',' When the app opens there is no way to jump to the note you want to edit (like an alphabetical list or letter table of contents to tap). ','?'
'id: 7778 ',' Evernote starts virgin each time instead of remembering where I last was (IE the note I was in), and the edit function is quirky when you try to tap an existing note to edit in that it doesn  t put the cursor where you tapped in the text but at the very end of the note, requiring scrolling (blech). ','?'
'id: 7778 ',' Very handy, good potential, needs work. ','?'
'id: 7780 ',' A simple, dynamic way to keep track of everything you need or want to do, read, see, make; a great tool for moving projects forward, keeping track of what gets done and what needs to happen next. ','?'
'id: 7783 ',' Never had a problem with it. ','?'
'id: 7796 ',' Still learning how to use the app. ','?'
'id: 7803 ',' I wish the would stop branching out   "Evernote Food", "Evernote Hello", Evernote Clearly","Evernote Peak" and just get the base right. ','?'
'id: 7809 ',' Definitely one of the most useful apps you can have. ','?'
'id: 7811 ',' It  s uncomfortable to know my personal writings are available to whoever picks up my phone. ','?'
'id: 7815 ',' The process of adding notes via the email address that Evernote assigned me stopped working after only 52 notes. ','?'
'id: 7815 ',' Since I need to add many more in order to switch from another memo App Evernote seems useless. ','?'
'id: 7826 ',' While most of my power computing is done with a MacBook in my office, I have everything I need via cloud and Evernote with me in my travels. ','?'
'id: 7826 ',' I want to suggest:\\n1. ','?'
'id: 7827 ',' \\n\\nI highly recommend Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7830 ',' It  s a little slow at times and I wish you could attach a PDF or picture to a specific note you have already created, if you can, I haven  t figured out how yet. ','?'
'id: 7833 ',' I have tried a few different note taking apps and they have all failed me until I tried Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7834 ',' My older iPad can  t quite keep up, and Evernote crashes often when I try to copy and paste from another app. ','?'
'id: 7845 ',' Now that I use both iPhone and iPad, along with OS X, I  m so glad I made the switch. ','?'
'id: 7854 ',' I  ve never had any issues. ','?'
'id: 7856 ',' This app is great for notes, books, library searching, and details, but the bugs make it my number two app for writing since it often crashes, takes up to half a minute to load, and just freezes when I am writing. ','?'
'id: 7859 ',' Many nice features and reliable on my iMac, but I really need it on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 7861 ',' I use it to plan, design, create everything from dinner to buying a new car. ','?'
'id: 7866 ',' But I need to pay my dues to the greatest note taking, life changing, reference tool out there. ','?'
'id: 7874 ',' I actually upgraded so I could retrieve info for my daughter a wedding and I still could not work on line. ','?'
'id: 7875 ',' Please make it so I can make thumbnails or size the pic within the notes or even make a "click to view" button. ','?'
'id: 7878 ',' Have used it everyday for years now and hasn  t failed me once. ','?'
'id: 7886 ',' It syncs between different instances of Evernote for the same account, which is awesome because that means I can use it on desktop, laptop, phone and Internet. ','?'
'id: 7887 ',' Example, if recording and you forget to stop recording, change networks and open up the app it loses the entire note the recording was associated with. ','?'
'id: 7892 ',' I needed to be shown about Evernote, but once I saw what it did I was hooked. ','?'
'id: 7893 ',' Last few updates have made Evernote on my iPhone even better than before. ','?'
'id: 7899 ',' \\n\\nMy only complaint is that a lot my notes aren  t available without network access even though I have it set up to DL all of my notes locally. ','?'
'id: 7906 ',' It does what I need it to do. ','?'
'id: 7907 ',' I also tried Notability, but it is only available on iPad, which is not useful for me. ','?'
'id: 7908 ',' I wish there was a way to organize all of my documents into separate folders. ','?'
'id: 7910 ',' I highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 7923 ',' I highly recommend Evernote! ','?'
'id: 7924 ',' I put everything I need to know and remember in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 7933 ',' I also use my Doxie Go to quickly scan and upload documents to Evernote The new Reminder feature is a big improvement..it would be even better to add ability to set recurring reminders. ','?'
'id: 7938 ',' I recommend it to anyone! ','?'
'id: 7939 ',' \\n I would love to see my notes in beautiful font and theme than just being a default option. ','?'
'id: 7940 ',' Awesome for everything, only hookup for me was not being able to have others edit my shared notebook. ','?'
'id: 7942 ',' Just started usin Evernote and I am now a loyal user ! ','?'
'id: 7948 ',' \\nI recommend it. ','?'
'id: 7952 ',' I no longer have to worry that I forgot my hard copies! ','?'
'id: 7952 ',' I always have what I need when I need it. ','?'
'id: 7956 ',' Since adding reminder functionality, this is a great app. ','?'
'id: 7957 ',' Always have access via phone, but nice to be able to access with iPad in a location where I can  t pull wi fi. ','?'
'id: 7963 ',' If you forget things or need to access data from multiple places this is a must have app. ','?'
'id: 7964 ',' It keeps saying   sending changes   at the top but fails to sync . ','?'
'id: 7966 ',' It just doesn  t work as well as it used to. ','?'
'id: 7977 ',' I think there should be different fonts as well as font sizes or colors, and that pictures can be made bigger or smaller. ','?'
'id: 7979 ',' \\nWish that you could nest notebooks more deeply, but that problem is probably best solved through better tagging, anyhow. ','?'
'id: 7980 ',' It doesn  t support creating stacks, merging notes, and you can  t edit created/modification dates from iOS. ','?'
'id: 7980 ',' The iPad app needs some love to get a better rating. ','?'
'id: 7982 ',' I had no problems before this update. ','?'
'id: 7982 ',' Others have had similar problems. ','?'
'id: 7998 ',' Katizzell ,  I  ve had zero problems, but I wish there was a checklist function. ','?'
'id: 8006 ',' You have to make an account just to make notes?! ','?'
'id: 8007 ',' Don  t know what else I would use besides this for all my note taking and clipping articles from the web! ','?'
'id: 8013 ',' I recommend Evernote to people who want a cross platform collection and organization tool. ','?'
'id: 8013 ',' \\n\\nOne of the coolest functions is that you can insert images of handwritten information into a note and search on text strings in those notes; Evernote has successfully (not in all cases, though) found the notes with those text strings. ','?'
'id: 8020 ',' Now it  s all cloud based which means I need to have wi fi access everyplace I go in order to see my files since the app no longer stores the file on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 8020 ',' It might be fine for others, but it no longer supports my needs. ','?'
'id: 8024 ',' The tags are what Word and windows are missing. ','?'
'id: 8024 ',' Information is so interrelated these days that everything needs to be cross indexed a dozen different ways. ','?'
'id: 8024 ',' It would be nice if the two communicated so that there could be a link in Evernote to bring you to a project schedule and a link Priority Matrix that would open and Evernote note. ','?'
'id: 8026 ',' All of my thoughts, notes, ideas and anything that I need to keep track of this app does that. ','?'
'id: 8027 ',' You have to go into the info page under every note to see the time and date it was created on. ','?'
'id: 8032 ',' I always have what I need anything I  m on my computer or phone. ','?'
'id: 8037 ',' If you constantly print out articles that you find interesting only to get disgusted by paper accumulation and just want to throw it all away, Evernote is the solution. ','?'
'id: 8040 ',' I can then download this to invoice 2 go and provide an invoice that is accurate   to the day and time and I am storing information as I am visiting! ','?'
'id: 8041 ',' The Secret Weapon website will show you how to use Evernote to the fullest. ','?'
'id: 8044 ',' I love how when you make a list You can add little checkable boxes in the list, great! ','?'
'id: 8045 ',' Getting your ideas into a format YOU can and WILL use, easily communicating them seamlessly with other apps and being able to share AND save them forever. ','?'
'id: 8053 ',' \\n\\nSeveral releases ago it had stability problems on the iPad in which I was saving often hoping to avoid data loss but those problems have been resolved an it is solid. ','?'
'id: 8053 ',' \\n\\n==Ver 5.3.2   Down a star just because it has a persistent problem with bulleted lists. ','?'
'id: 8053 ',' Inserting a sub bullet into an existing bulleted list often creates a phantom bullet item with no text and I cannot move the cursor to it. ','?'
'id: 8053 ',' Only real problem and it  s minor. ','?'
'id: 8060 ',' Don  t just download it, use it! ','?'
'id: 8061 ',' But, is there a way of writing words or letters colour as it is in MS Word? ','?'
'id: 8067 ',' What I like most is that you can login and update your notes anywhere anytime. ','?'
'id: 8071 ',' One of the most useful apps available! ','?'
'id: 8076 ',' In classroom, while I record every word , I type notes, but I have to keep paper handy because sometimes I need to draw anything in the text. ','?'
'id: 8084 ',' I use it constantly and made a commitment this year to use this app exclusively. ','?'
'id: 8090 ',' Use it to write a book, create a to do list, collab with coworkers, design your house, plan a wedding, collect inspiration, and keep it all on one place , ','?'
'id: 8100 ',' Very happy with the mobile app, the desk top has some bugs though , ','?'
'id: 8232 ',' You can find anything you need in a mound of information. ','?'
'id: 8232 ',' \\n\\nOverall I  d say you really can  t go wrong. ','?'
'id: 8237 ',' \\n\\nI could go on, but this added "Feature" would be hard to top, if top is the word. ','?'
'id: 8241 ',' Overall works great, it just has the occasional bugs that any app has. ','?'
'id: 8247 ',' You can link so many other apps and tools to EN tandem have them at your figure tips wherever you are and when you need them. ','?'
'id: 8260 ',' After reading a paper in Harvard Business review on how to use Evernote for collaborative team work, I realized I had discovered a seriously useful tool. ','?'
'id: 8260 ',' Why is this so important? ','?'
'id: 8260 ',' The iPhone and iPad provide convenience of location for accessing email. ','?'
'id: 8266 ',' \\n\\nAdditionally, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date. ','?'
'id: 8269 ',' Evernote is everything I expected plus more! ','?'
'id: 8274 ',' I love the new things you have added it helps me stay on what I need to do ! ','?'
'id: 8280 ',' However, it is   still   missing a quality way to directly send notes from an iOS browser. ','?'
'id: 8290 ',' Love that I can take picture notes and get a memory jog just by looking at the "post it". ','?'
'id: 8295 ',' It would be nice if they were preserved. ','?'
'id: 8304 ',' it provides the flexibility to keep track of all the divergent projects I  m working on, in a way that works for my haywire brain! ','?'
'id: 8310 ',' If you travel meeting to meeting and have to take notes you have to download it. ','?'
'id: 8312 ',' Only issue so far is: once I had the icon on excel, word, and many other apps. ','?'
'id: 8312 ',' This was a very good gadget for I didn  t have to go back to open Evernote or copy paste, I just clicked and so. ','?'
'id: 8313 ',' However, I thought whenI emailed my note to someone that they could have the option of saving it in their own evernote account. ','?'
'id: 8314 ',' I use it every day to collect the fiddly bits of information I need to keep track of. ','?'
'id: 8328 ',' I only need one copy of the note which is in its notebook. ','?'
'id: 8328 ',' We should have the option of being able to delete the note once its placed in the notebook in the all notes section. ','?'
'id: 8332 ',' It just has a steep learning curve, but once you get it down pat it will make your life so much better. ','?'
'id: 8339 ',' What happened to the notebook view in the latest version? ','?'
'id: 8339 ',' Tell me how to get to it if I  m missing something or BRING IT BACK if you took it out! ','?'
'id: 8350 ',' Sometimes not all notes are available when not on wireless network. ','?'
'id: 8352 ',' Have had relatively few problems, and this app has been very useful; it  s nice to have such versatility in a note app, and to be able to have all my notes available on all my devices. ','?'
'id: 8358 ',' Highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 8369 ',' It  s great to store notes, documents, memories, etc, that you never want to forget, or you think might be useful in the future. ','?'
'id: 8371 ',' The best thing   it is the true integrated solution meaning it is the connective tissue I need across all devices, apps, functions, etc. ','?'
'id: 8372 ',' Cross platform so I can use it everywhere. ','?'
'id: 8372 ',' \\nEvernote Hello really needs work, but Evernote Food is also terrific; a bit more confusing to start, but very useful. ','?'
'id: 8373 ',' I use to really love this app, ( I didn  t use it much but I still love to have it for a " just in case situation ", however , they messed it all up when they do a password reset , putting the password in wasn  t the problem, the problem is that they want five common words to Verify the account , I rarely used it, HOW AM I TO REMEMBER WORDS THAT I  VE USED? ','?'
'id: 8373 ',' THAT  S WHY I HAVE THIS APP, INCASE I FORGET SOMETHING I CAN OPEN THE APP AND BE REMINDED !!!! ','?'
'id: 8375 ',' Finally, the most important feature added last. ','?'
'id: 8375 ',' Why were Reminders not added earlier? ','?'
'id: 8383 ',' I   knock on wood   am yet to have a problem with Evernote. ','?'
'id: 8390 ',' Please don  t loose any of my stuff. ','?'
'id: 8392 ',' I just knocked off another star for those. ','?'
'id: 8393 ',' \\n\\nUPDATE:  Please provide background syncing for notes! ','?'
'id: 8395 ',' Please add text expander support, and I will rate it 6 stars. ','?'
'id: 8403 ',' But...there is a but, small in comparison to the benefits...the apps need to integrate better! ','?'
'id: 8405 ',' I just wish it had time stamps included, or maybe I am missing them somewhere. ','?'
'id: 8406 ',' I understand UI restraints mainly in connection with tagging and notebook management on the iPhone, while I think the iPad version should bring a very similar workflow as the website. ','?'
'id: 8406 ',' To bring an example: when you want to manage tags of one specific note you have to go into the info panel and than select tags in the panel and than browse through the tags or add new while on the web there is the dedicated space above the note for tags. ','?'
'id: 8408 ',' \\n\\nEveryone needs Evernote. ','?'
'id: 8417 ',' This is my favorite app on the market, but it crashes every time I try to go on it on my iPad it crashes. ','?'
'id: 8417 ',' Hopefully the solution will be in the next update. ','?'
'id: 8432 ',' I  d give it 4.5 stars if I could only because there are some merely niggling issues I have, but Evernote keeps getting better. ','?'
'id: 8448 ',' \\n\\nThe only bug I  ve found is that Evernote crashes when adding tags to new notes on iPad or iPhone. ','?'
'id: 8448 ',' I upload photos, scanned documents and web clippings (I don  t bother with the web clipper, I usually just upload screenshots from the iPad or iPhone). ','?'
'id: 8449 ',' I love this app but currently there seems to be a problem with scrolling down to the bottom of the note. ','?'
'id: 8449 ',' Please fix this issue. ','?'
'id: 8457 ',' They could offer a lot more. ','?'
'id: 8458 ',' \\n\\nHere  s your rating Evernote since you wanted to know what I think. ','?'
'id: 8458 ',' I think you can do better. ','?'
'id: 8462 ',' If it spit out gold coins, some Would have problems with it. ','?'
'id: 8462 ',' \\n\\nDefinitely an app to try   and you  ll find ways you can  t live without it. ','?'
'id: 8468 ',' If I need quick access to a note I don  t want to take the time to enter my password. ','?'
'id: 8468 ',' If I need sync then ask me for the password. ','?'
'id: 8473 ',' I use it constantly to update my student  s homework. ','?'
'id: 8474 ',' Highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 8479 ',' But my Reeder does not work well with it. ','?'
'id: 8481 ',' It would be nice if it worked more uniformly across devices: PCs, Mac, IPhone, iPad, Blachberry, etc. , ','?'
'id: 8482 ',' If I could only have 1 app it would be this one. ','?'
'id: 8484 ',' If I decide on something during the day, I can easily look at my iPhone app and check to see what ingredients I need to pick up. ','?'
'id: 8488 ',' I did have some syncing issues with it on my windows computer but with tech support it was resolved. ','?'
'id: 8490 ',' (~50% are missing)\\n  text editor in desktop app is appalling. ','?'
'id: 8493 ',' Instead of just jotting down a note (which I can  t always do) and referring to it later on once I  ve gotten home, logged onto a computer, &amp; opened up a Word document, it  s so much easier and convenient to do it on this app. ','?'
'id: 8498 ',' I am really getting to know how to use this app and I am really liking the ability to add notes to my tweets when I can  t get in everything I want to say. ','?'
'id: 8502 ',' Would it be possible to add the ability to make sub folders inside each notebook? ','?'
'id: 8513 ',' I just love Evernote it has helped me so much especially because I have a brain injury and lose paper documents all the time. ','?'
'id: 8515 ',' I just wish you could pause when recording. ','?'
'id: 8520 ',' The editor is terrible and it needs a total makeover. ','?'
'id: 8527 ',' The reminders recently added are handy as well , ','?'
'id: 8534 ',' Evernote has made our desks cleaner plus access to documents a whole lot easier in our business. ','?'
'id: 8535 ',' Just pull up a voice memo, camera, or type it out and place it in a folder. ','?'
'id: 8536 ',' Great product that really makes the iPad useful (for me), but I would like to have more text controls. ','?'
'id: 8536 ',' I like the clean interface, but some way to access more of the style options would be great. ','?'
'id: 8537 ',' It gives me a way to organize all my thoughts, files, important emails, and lists in a way that makes things easy to access and find when I need them the most. ','?'
'id: 8539 ',' Good  app, could be very useful to manage info in all areas of life. ','?'
'id: 8555 ',' I am getting some problems when I open Evernote on iPad. ','?'
'id: 8562 ',' Runs really well never crashes. ','?'
'id: 8562 ',' I can  t live without Evernote it  s a MUST for Everybody and everything personal business,  There  s too many things in this life you need to remember, And get to all time easily. ','?'
'id: 8563 ',' You need it. ','?'
'id: 8564 ',' I lost all my nots 2 times it happened and no I didn  t delete them I update it and lost all of my nots!!! ','?'
'id: 8565 ',' This is a terrific app., i recommend it to everyone that i meet. ','?'
'id: 8574 ',' Great tool, especially on the go when you need to jot down notes. ','?'
'id: 8575 ',' Never had a problem with this app. ','?'
'id: 8577 ',' As advertised, I can drop just about anything into it on one device, effectively file the info to a notebook and tag it, and have it available on all my devices. ','?'
'id: 8578 ',' Tech support suggests using "right click" but that is not an option on a phone. ','?'
'id: 8583 ',' There doesn  t seem to be a problem. ','?'
'id: 8583 ',' It would be nice if that didn  t happen. ','?'
'id: 8584 ',' but the problem is it will always have a conflict note across all platforms if I edit my notes on my phone. ','?'
'id: 8584 ',' \\nProblem no.2 is When taking photos as my note, I can  t preview them to decide whether the pictures   quality is good enough to be inserted into my note. ','?'
'id: 8590 ',' I definitely recommend it :) , ','?'
'id: 8592 ',' If you want to try GTD with Evernote, take a look at the Secret Weapon tutorial videos. ','?'
'id: 8601 ',' I love this app &amp; been using if for years but the version has issue. ','?'
'id: 8601 ',' Every time I do something it tells me it can  t sync. ','?'
'id: 8603 ',' From the day I found it two years ago and every day since, I  ve learned how to streamline my life and my work, to record all the important elements of both and to share ideas and projects with my team around the world. ','?'
'id: 8605 ',' The only true downfall is that there is no sound to go along with the reminder, atleast I can  t seem to find one. ','?'
'id: 8605 ',' If there isn  t maybe it could be incorporated into the next update. ','?'
'id: 8608 ',' Of course it  s not a Microsoft Word, but it  s simple, easy and you can use everywhere you want. ','?'
'id: 8611 ',' It supports font types and size, it just isn  t as easy as I  d like to do so. ','?'
'id: 8616 ',' Evernote fails this first requisite. ','?'
'id: 8621 ',' Was recommended to try this app for 3 months. ','?'
'id: 8621 ',' Finally did, and can  t believe what i was missing. ','?'
'id: 8621 ',' What is paper and pencil? ','?'
'id: 8622 ',' All contracts, all documents, everything that I used to spend time on filling is now available everywhere within seconds. ','?'
'id: 8625 ',' I highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 8630 ',' I used to fill up 12 notebooks a year and then when I needed to find something I would have to flip thru multiple notebooks to find that notation. ','?'
'id: 8631 ',' The apps have tried to provide means for taming the resulting pile, with varying success. ','?'
'id: 8631 ',' Saved searches   one of the most powerful features    also needs a UI investment. ','?'
'id: 8633 ',' I love how I can use it on my iPad, iPhone and PC and it syncs to all devices. ','?'
'id: 8634 ',' My only advice is that you have to go all in with this app, otherwise you won  t realize the true value. ','?'
'id: 8636 ',' The only thing that annoys me is not being able to access it all offline without paying but I guess they have to give some incentive for buying..don  t have the money to spare for something extra like that but sure would be nice if I did. ','?'
'id: 8637 ',' It has been the single tool that has allowed me to compile and organize years and years of writing: fiction, reviews, lyrics, and other important information allowing me to actually begin to make use of it and creating a more paperless lifestyle. ','?'
'id: 8638 ',' I honestly think this is the greatest app ever and I would die if I could not use it. ','?'
'id: 8641 ',' I haven  t had any problems. ','?'
'id: 8646 ',' This app does most of what I need. ','?'
'id: 8647 ',' Yea there may be a bug or two, but this service is a lifesaver for a busy entrepreneur trying to keep track of a dozen things , ','?'
'id: 8648 ',' I have had this installed on my iPad I have been unable to run Utube or similar videos. ','?'
'id: 8651 ',' I used to find evernote to be a pretty useful app for some things, but the real value is unlocked when you just decide you  re going to use Evernote for everything. ','?'
'id: 8651 ',' If I need to scan a document, I just use the scan feature in Evernote, and my scanned docs become searchable. ','?'
'id: 8651 ',' For me, this isn  t a huge deal, but when I recommend the apps to others, it can be a problem, because if you really use evernote exclusively (as I recommended above), then you might find yourself SOL if you  re in traveling and don  t have reliable access to Internet. ','?'
'id: 8653 ',' It took me some time to figure out how to use this tool in my life, but now it is indispensable in managing ALL work and personal tasks, goals, details. ','?'
'id: 8664 ',' I have been using this on off for about 6 to 8 months and then I began to understand how to use key features such as tagging, linking notes and it is now becoming my go to for tracking activity, projects, and reference materials organized. ','?'
'id: 8664 ',' Evernote is also a platform that will support a lot of the ideas from David Allan  s book, "Getting Things Done"\\n\\nLastly I love having access to my info across multiple devices. ','?'
'id: 8675 ',' I use it for everything, especially when I need to write something on the go. ','?'
'id: 8678 ',' Shared notebooks need the option to allow delegates to make changes. ','?'
'id: 8701 ',' \\n\\nAlso, you really do need to be a very well organized person, with a strong filing system before you start, because it  s really easy to send bookmarks, and notes, and web clips, and sites saved in Clearly to Evernote, and end up with them all scrambled u. because your Evernote email address changed and because you forgot the hint about how to get them into the right notebook, and you can  t remember how to make a notebook, and when you clip in Clearly and go to edit, there is no way to edit what notebook the note goes into (in fact there seems to be no way to edit at all) so your note will be in some notebook or other when you go to look for it. ','?'
'id: 8701 ',' Even though I  ve bought two e books about Evernote, and poured over the online help, I still cannot figure out how to make a new notebook on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 8701 ',' \\n\\nI am generally good at learning how to use new apps &amp; programs, and  I do read help sections carefully. ','?'
'id: 8703 ',' I would also suggest a good calendar app for anyone looking for ever more organization. ','?'
'id: 8708 ',' It  s the app that I use the most, please keep improving this great app, now finally with reminders! ','?'
'id: 8709 ',' In general, formatting could be improved. ','?'
'id: 8714 ',' I run a business and caretake two individuals   everything I need is with me. ','?'
'id: 8715 ',' I also created a notebook in which I can store old entries for future reference. ','?'
'id: 8715 ',' \\n\\nUnfortunately, I can  t view, add or change any of my notebooks on the website. ','?'
'id: 8715 ',' I  m also having trouble logging in to Evernote using the MacBook App, so I haven  t been able to use it on my computer, which I would be nice to be able to do. ','?'
'id: 8715 ',' I also think small pics should be the default rather than large pictures  that kind f threw me off at first when I emailed something to a friend. ','?'
'id: 8723 ',' I can add photos and  voice memos, I can dictate thoughts. ','?'
'id: 8725 ',' I can  t access any of my notes. ','?'
'id: 8730 ',' I have had a synch problem or two   just not synched when I needed it to be. ','?'
'id: 8733 ',' I love that you can access your notes from anywhere. ','?'
'id: 8735 ',' Then I updated the note on my phone, and later found that it hadn  t updated anywhere else. ','?'
'id: 8743 ',' I recommend this app , ','?'
'id: 8745 ',' That  s the principal problem with all iOS programs. ','?'
'id: 8752 ',' Would love to see tasks added. ','?'
'id: 8754 ',' Using this to plan my wedding and to make note of things I want to do and places to go. ','?'
'id: 8755 ',' This app has made my job and life so much easier! ','?'
'id: 8755 ',' It is available on all platforms and syncs automatically. ','?'
'id: 8755 ',' I have been using this for about a year now and I have never had an issue with losing notes. ','?'
'id: 8756 ',' I don  t have any problems with this app. ','?'
'id: 8757 ',' I am also unable to email the existing info. ','?'
'id: 8763 ',' I love that I can add photos and audio! ','?'
'id: 8767 ',' I sometimes forget that it uploads my notes to the Evernote site and that I can use it on the internet, but that is another plus, because my notes are accessible if I am away from my iPad. ','?'
'id: 8768 ',' If you haven  t tried Evernote, what are you waiting for? ','?'
'id: 8772 ',' I  m still learning how to use it, but have come to rely heavily on it. ','?'
'id: 8772 ',' Wish it would let me create deeper nests of notebooks, but maybe I jut haven  t figured that out yet. ','?'
'id: 8784 ',' There are really no set ways to keep track of all your paperwork and activities of life but Evernote simply gives you all the tools you need to get a handle on some form of accountability for your time and work. ','?'
'id: 8785 ',' mscheerful ,  Evernote has made my life so much more organized! ','?'
'id: 8789 ',' I just wish you could video directly in the app. ','?'
'id: 8790 ',' Once you start hiving every piece of info into Evernote, you can search and find anything you need very quickly. ','?'
'id: 8793 ',' Now if I am at store I can pull it up and see what I need and or share with a friend! ','?'
'id: 8799 ',' On the iPad I have not figured out how to do this so all the notebooks are in one big pile alphabetically. ','?'
'id: 8800 ',' No more wasted time hunting down much needed info. ','?'
'id: 8802 ',' Why don  t you have this already? ','?'
'id: 8812 ',' Please keep up the great work and because everyone will be using this app soon enough. ','?'
'id: 8815 ',' Adding reminders to notes is genius! ','?'
'id: 8822 ',' I need sync. ','?'
'id: 8826 ',' Now I don  t forget anything. ','?'
'id: 8833 ',' I always have what I need where I need it. ','?'
'id: 8834 ',' Prett much everything I need in note taking software. ','?'
'id: 8836 ',' Great app you can use for everything and anything you need/want to organize your life! ','?'
'id: 8838 ',' I use it all the time, I just love it. ','?'
'id: 8843 ',' And it would be nice to be able to rearrange the tabs too. ','?'
'id: 8858 ',' I hasn  t failed me yet. ','?'
'id: 8859 ',' I definitely recommend this if you seem to need to type down short things. ','?'
'id: 8863 ',' Seriously, everything I want and need to do and all the ways I want to take notes  annotated and tagged images clippings, articles, news reports, etc  offered in a nicely bound package that helps keep organized. ','?'
'id: 8865 ',' It took me a while to figure out how to use the new version but now I like it. ','?'
'id: 8869 ',' I now use Evernote for everything after paperport failed me . ','?'
'id: 8874 ',' The only problem is that the international account is very slow when syncing in China. ','?'
'id: 8874 ',' How to solve that? ','?'
'id: 8875 ',' I only wish there was a way that i can bookmark or save at a specific place in a document, that way if i  m switching between notes i \\nalways come back on the same place, and not have to scroll my way back from the beginning. ','?'
'id: 8875 ',' I also think they need to add a lock feature, so that you can lock a note and prevent it from being edited this would help a lot when you  re sharing notes. ','?'
'id: 8883 ',' Great app with the exception that reminders need an audible alert that is customizable. ','?'
'id: 8887 ',' However, beginning today it immediately crashes as soon as I open it. ','?'
'id: 8887 ',' This is very disappointing as I have information I need to access/add. ','?'
'id: 8887 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 8889 ',' Please consider adding this much needed feature. ','?'
'id: 8891 ',' This application has provided me with a great solution to holding onto documents that I need to access when I am in various locations. ','?'
'id: 8895 ',' App supports a wide range of features but as a primary note taking App it lacks a fast launch and overall speed across the entire App. ','?'
'id: 8895 ',' Also needs ability to search using some command strings like search only note title. ','?'
'id: 8895 ',' Since I use this heavily every search query for me brings too many results whereas most of the time I only need to search note titles. ','?'
'id: 8904 ',' Just start a new note, tap the camera icon, and either take a new photo or paste an old one. ','?'
'id: 8905 ',' I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 8907 ',' So I decided I needed something better. ','?'
'id: 8908 ',' So, the only problem I have is the fact we can  t change the font or font size. ','?'
'id: 8908 ',' Only way for me to get the size I want is to go online and find something with the right font and size, paste it into notebook, then start writing. ','?'
'id: 8912 ',' Has made my life easy ! ','?'
'id: 8913 ',' This version of the client (5.2.3) is excellent and I use it to outsource parts of my brain, carrying my iPad and iPhone (and now my Moleskine) everywhere my desktop client can  t go. ','?'
'id: 8914 ',' When I called customer support they asked for a screen shot, which of course I could not provide. ','?'
'id: 8915 ',' just love it! ','?'
'id: 8920 ',' My favorite feature is having all my notes on all my devices and all my computers so I can use whichever one fits my current situation. ','?'
'id: 8937 ',' I love that I can use it on my computer, my tablet, and my phone. ','?'
'id: 8938 ',' Works great w the flexibility to have the notes transfered and quickly available on ipad iphone mac and on web version. ','?'
'id: 8939 ',' I take it to every meeting I attend and every conference where I need to take notes. ','?'
'id: 8940 ',' \\n\\nRecent upgrades have just made it all the better. ','?'
'id: 8940 ',' I can  t imaging going to a meeting now without it! ','?'
'id: 8943 ',' Inserting pictures and audio is a breeze and really helps me capture what I need to remember. ','?'
'id: 8946 ',' What I like about living in the Information Age is how you can use infotech to harness the electromagnetic energy of the brain to go deeper. ','?'
'id: 8954 ',' It communicates between all of my devices and I love adding pictures, notes and tags. ','?'
'id: 8959 ',' I am ready to convert it all to Evernote notes and store them nicely in binders I can create from my iPhone, iPad, PC, Macbook, etc. ','?'
'id: 8966 ',' Especially useful for keeping all my recipes handy so I can plan dinner on the way to the grocery store. ','?'
'id: 8973 ',' When I click the reset email it says that email expired so basically I can  t use Evernote. ','?'
'id: 8976 ',' In a world that requires varying types of passwords for different sites, Evernote allows quick access to entries to remind you of your account numbers, IDs, and password hints. ','?'
'id: 8976 ',' I thoroughly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 8979 ',' I  d love it more if I could\\n1) move notes to different notebooks\\n2) delete empty notebooks\\n3) use the web interface from my iPad   this just does not work correctly. ','?'
'id: 8986 ',' I definitely recommend this app for anyone who needs help organizing or remembering things. ','?'
'id: 8988 ',' I have never had a problem with it syncing across platforms. ','?'
'id: 8991 ',' There was an issue with a breach in security and I was asked to change my password. ','?'
'id: 8993 ',' But they do have to make money somehow so I  m ok with it. ','?'
'id: 8995 ',' Evernote is a great idea and utility. ','?'
'id: 8995 ',' How about general documentation, formatting, etc? ','?'
'id: 8995 ',' \\n\\nThose would all be great things that could make Evernote the end all be all for everything for everyone. ','?'
'id: 8995 ',' I understand that they would need to change the pricing model a bit, but it  s not inconceivable, impossible, or so far fetched to imagine how to accomplish that. ','?'
'id: 9011 ',' This app however lacks many of the greatest features of Evernote and it still requires you to use the Desktop app to access and setup those features. ','?'
'id: 9015 ',' You can use it as a simple note taker or turn it into the library of congress (but likely far more indexed, tagged, and searchable I might note!) ','?'
'id: 9018 ',' Love that I can use this wherever I need to. ','?'
'id: 9022 ',' I will enter info on my iphone, ipad, or on my PC. ','?'
'id: 9028 ',' I would however really like to see multi level bulleted and numbered lists added. ','?'
'id: 9032 ',' I use Evernote to store work notes and just about every piece of paper at home that I need to hold on to for one reason or another. ','?'
'id: 9036 ',' The only criticism of the software may just be due to my own lack of knowledge in using it, but I do often feel that I  d like to have a more traditional file hierarchy when it comes to my notes and notebooks. ','?'
'id: 9037 ',' I  ve given it 4 stars because I  m haven  t been able to find a web clipper for my iPad and don  t know why there isn  t one available? ','?'
'id: 9039 ',' It  s great to have all my notes available on my Phone, iPad and Mac. ','?'
'id: 9040 ',' You definitely need this app. ','?'
'id: 9041 ',' I use Evernote for everything I need to organize at home and at work! ','?'
'id: 9041 ',' I keep meeting notes, shopping lists, and things I need to accomplish. ','?'
'id: 9046 ',' I have way too much going on in life to remember it all   this way I have instant access to anything I need to recall and more. ','?'
'id: 9052 ',' This is what you need. ','?'
'id: 9053 ',' I highly recommend it , ','?'
'id: 9056 ',' Both Evernote &amp; Evernote hello have made my iPhone a better product. ','?'
'id: 9059 ',' Evernote is great for not just writing notes, but extensive documents. ','?'
'id: 9071 ',' I am able to be completely paperless and am not forgetting the things that are important to me because of this app. ','?'
'id: 9073 ',' Where a twelve step program failed, Evernote has saved me. ','?'
'id: 9073 ',' If you want to remember it, if you need to remember it, Evernote it! ','?'
'id: 9078 ',' I really love the that you can format your notes how you would in as a Word document, with headings, alignment, bold, italics, bullets and numbering, etc. ','?'
'id: 9079 ',' this move is apparently irreversible and I can no longer see the photos I took of passages from the book I have read, which I was planning to quote/cite later. ','?'
'id: 9079 ',' if I am to use an app that allows for this much thought and effort to be stored within it, I need to be able to trust that my work will not be lost with a simple touch screen selection error. ','?'
'id: 9081 ',' \\n\\nBest ideas are sometimes obvious. ','?'
'id: 9089 ',' This app is great for jotting down notes and keeping them organized..the tabs are an easy way to find what you are looking for..although I would love to see an option to move the notes from notebook to notebook . ','?'
'id: 9090 ',' Guess im still looking for ways that i can really use this, but so far so good. ','?'
'id: 9093 ',' I put anything worth saving here, and it  s the first place I look when I need to access information later. ','?'
'id: 9095 ',' I  m sure that I don  t know how to fully utilize it. ','?'
'id: 9100 ',' My computer memory is so full from pictures, that saving anything becomes difficult at times, and Evernote helps so much with that, especially as often as it automatically saves what you  re doing! ','?'
'id: 9110 ',' I really have been missing the benefits of Evernote! ','?'
'id: 9112 ',' I take pictures for work and need to add notes to each photo. ','?'
'id: 9121 ',' \\n\\nI probably spend an hour or more in Evernote, adding new things like receipts or copies of important paperwork (and shredding all the paper) or better organizing what I  ve already added. ','?'
'id: 9121 ',' I don  t have to worry that I "need to get it right" since changing how you do things is not very difficult or time consuming. ','?'
'id: 9125 ',' As a business owner at 49 yrs old, I love all the new things (tools) available in the work place (and cloud based) such as Evernote. ','?'
'id: 9126 ',' If I can remember that welI i don  t need Evernotes! ','?'
'id: 9130 ',' I have been using Evernote for the past 2 years and recently, it has been crashing on me constantly. ','?'
'id: 9134 ',' Will give the fifth star when dual tag functionality becomes available so that I can filter my to do list down to 1 Now @Home. ','?'
'id: 9136 ',' \\n\\nNote: I am not fond of Business Evernote, it needs some fine tuning with regards to pricing and features. ','?'
'id: 9155 ',' I  m a big fan and highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 9156 ',' I can create text, image and audio notations to accurately represent any ideas and concepts. ','?'
'id: 9162 ',' Finally, an app that helps organize the millions of things you need to remember, research, buy, or just put somewhere. ','?'
'id: 9163 ',' It syncs beautifully between iPod and MacBook, so all my notes are available when and where I need them. ','?'
'id: 9170 ',' When I need to remember something I use Evernote! ','?'
'id: 9171 ',' Evernote has truly revolutionized how I do everything   from work, to home, to hobbies, Evernote has made my life organized and effective. ','?'
'id: 9181 ',' I use it dozens of times a day, for everything from work to helping me plan my wedding to grocery shopping lists. ','?'
'id: 9187 ',' Above and beyond the incredible features and ease of use of the Evernote system the iPad app provides an exceptional experience by specifically tailoring the iPad experience to best suit the iPad interface and mentality. ','?'
'id: 9187 ',' The app also considers the graphical, hands on style of the iPad with strong parallels to notebooks and filing cabinets providing a level of familiarity and pleasing form factor that thoroughly impresses. ','?'
'id: 9189 ',' I also wish it would allow me to put the cursor anywhere on the screen like you can do in the desktop application. ','?'
'id: 9192 ',' I like adding Excel and PDFs to my notes. ','?'
'id: 9193 ',' Leave the paper behind and have the information you need on any Internet enabled device always. ','?'
'id: 9196 ',' On my Apple iPhone you can even use the dictation portion to enter notes which makes it much faster. ','?'
'id: 9199 ',' Here is why: many times I had issues with it screwing up the format of things I would try to paste from other websites, it didn  t have an option to allow me to post a website into a specific set of notes. ','?'
'id: 9204 ',' I would love to see an enhancement to allow the mobile user to rotate photos. ','?'
'id: 9205 ',' A few differences in the interfaces on the various devices but nothing you can  t figure out on your own. ','?'
'id: 9213 ',' EyeRonik1 ,  My wife lost 3 days of notes from a conference when the app crashed. ','?'
'id: 9220 ',' Evernote was quite handy when I was looking to buy a house. ','?'
'id: 9223 ',' This app allows me to plan projects with ease. ','?'
'id: 9234 ',' \\nI highly recommend Evernote to others. ','?'
'id: 9237 ',' Secondly I know you can encrypt sections of the note and notes are transferred over SSL BUT I  d really like to have contents of note\\n\\nDecrypted on app when I sign in\\nEncrypted prior to being sent over wire and stored encrypted. ','?'
'id: 9243 ',' Very useful for organizing notes, adding pics, and keeping track of diff things in diff folders. ','?'
'id: 9249 ',' Lately Evernote has been giving me error messages every time I update a note on my iPhone. ','?'
'id: 9249 ',' Why can  t Evernote offer specific services for specific rates. ','?'
'id: 9251 ',' And anyone who needs to save a thought before they forget it. ','?'
'id: 9251 ',' \\n\\nIt would be nice to have a Folder or Category option. ','?'
'id: 9253 ',' \\n\\nI only wish there were more explicit instructions on how to use Evernote that is the only reason I  m not giving it a 5 rating. ','?'
'id: 9253 ',' I understand there are far broader  uses for this app, but I can  t seem to figure them out, and it  s not clear how to get technical support. ','?'
'id: 9260 ',' Love that you can add it to your browser and clip websites straight in. ','?'

'id: 9295 ',' G ,  This app is a testament to anyone who thought a simple notepad application could not be improved! ','?'
'id: 9310 ',' \\n\\nIn the last couple of releases they added a lot of functionality. ','?'
'id: 9310 ',' I particularly need to see word counts. ','?'
'id: 9310 ',' Please consider adding this. ','?'
'id: 9310 ',' The offline notebooks and sharing capabilities alone are well worth the price, if you need them. ','?'

'id: 9335 ',' I use it all the time and recommend it without reservation. ','?'
'id: 9362 ',' Note change you can now edit non text notes with iPad version. ','?'
'id: 9377 ',' This provides the opportunity to capture a thought, modify notes, and capture images  at a moments notice and have access to them at any time. ','?'
'id: 9389 ',' What I can  t find is a way to delete old notes. ','?'
'id: 9389 ',' If there is a way to do so it  s not clear. ','?'
'id: 9393 ',' Because of Evernote, it is all instantly available and searchable on all my devices. ','?'
'id: 9395 ',' \\n\\nThe app works generally as expected, but the main issue I have with it is the frequent background crashes. ','?'
'id: 9397 ',' That being said, I could REALLY use a way to enter symbols easier (greek, especially) considering I take notes for physics and chemistry and even, if possible, an equation editor. ','?'
'id: 9401 ',' I wish the app was available in my corporate environment. ','?'
'id: 9403 ',' Has added a nice organic structure to my life while allowing me to be my creative and somewhat unstructured self. ','?'
'id: 9407 ',' With a full time job (non writing) and parent, I have to catch time when I can and this app provides the access and power I need. ','?'
'id: 9410 ',' I remember there was an email sent out by the "Evernote Powers That Be" stating that Evernote  s primary market would be tablet users who needed the ability to enter handwritten notes and have them recognized as text; thus the pricing was a bit high. ','?'
'id: 9419 ',' (Which also means you may never have to print it, either.) ','?'
'id: 9425 ',' I tried to edit a note on my Touch but the next day, when I connected, the information I added had vanished. ','?'
'id: 9429 ',' You can use it just for simple notes, or organize your whole life with it  I sit somewhere in the middle, and am only just now exploring its document saving capacities. ','?'

'id: 9452 ',' It has been fantastically useful; the bugs are annoying sometimes; syncing can be slow. ','?'
'id: 9453 ',' Scalable and versatile enough that you can easily adapt it to your personal style and the way you think, rather than  having to crimp your style in order to get the functionality you need. ','?'
'id: 9457 ',' I can create notes, record meetings, and take snapshots. ','?'
'id: 9460 ',' I thought for a while if I really needed a notes app and then decided to give Evernote a try. ','?'
'id: 9469 ',' It provides efficiency in both work and home life. ','?'
'id: 9476 ',' I highly recommend this apps for anyone who need to track great deal of informations, in order to increase his or her productivities. ','?'
'id: 9477 ',' That could be that I just haven  t figured it out, but if it  s there it  s not obvious. ','?'

'id: 9483 ',' If you need a place to store and retrieve information then Evernote will work great for you. ','?'

'id: 9514 ',' \\n\\nIt would also be nice if Evernote helped you to create a todo list. ','?'
'id: 9514 ',' It would be nice if there were more font options on my iPad. ','?'

'id: 9539 ',' I  m teaching myself how to cook now that I  m disabled, and having a Cooking notebook with multiple sub notebooks such as Recipes, Hints &amp; Tips, Nutrition, etc., helps me record and later quickly and easily find what I need. ','?'
'id: 9541 ',' Highly recommend this app! ','?'
'id: 9542 ',' \\n\\nThe ability to sync my meeting notes across tools is critical and and has helped me in my work. ','?'
'id: 9545 ',' With a little effort you can integrate all info you  ll need in this app. ','?'
'id: 9545 ',' Just try it! ','?'
'id: 9549 ',' Please fix this Evernote! ','?'
'id: 9554 ',' Just learned the link feature today and can  t wait to put my files in order using it. ','?'
'id: 9556 ',' I use this app daily for keeping notes and organizing the things I need to remember. ','?'
'id: 9563 ',' You still have to use screen. ','?'
'id: 9584 ',' I love this app, but if I am relying on it to sync between all my devices and I magically can  t find my most important notes, this is a problem. ','?'
'id: 9588 ',' Serenes ,  Every time someone says "I need to keep track of something" or "I need a place where all of us can share ideas"   I always recommend Evernote. ','?'
'id: 9588 ',' Yes, there is google docs or Dropbox for document sharing, but usually I just need to jot down an idea, and this is perfect for it. ','?'
'id: 9603 ',' Love the fact that you can add photos, audio and even web clips (on the computer). ','?'
'id: 9607 ',' I thought it was cool, but did not really think I would use it. ','?'
'id: 9611 ',' $45 well spent to have access to my work files whenever I need them and organized so perfectly on my laptop, cell, and IPad. ','?'
'id: 9620 ',' For everything I do, from Boy Scouts to Sunday School to the office, I have what I need organized in different note books. ','?'
'id: 9623 ',' I went to open a doc I created about a year ago, and it was gone. ','?'
'id: 9635 ',' love that I can add a soundtrack to my notes. ','?'
'id: 9636 ',' Please bring it to the next level so I can use 1 app once and for all. ','?'
'id: 9642 ',' Evernote has helped me become a more organized person and to have documents, thoughts/ideas, and journal entries readily available. ','?'
'id: 9647 ',' Only annoying part is that you can  t highlight and drag text around even on a PC. ','?'
'id: 9649 ',' Evernote has everything I need! ','?'
'id: 9650 ',' But this is not really an Evernote problem at all   more to do with needing more processing power on ipad 3. ','?'
'id: 9651 ',' On the phone, it seems you cannot delete voice memos. ','?'
'id: 9652 ',' If you need a program to store random notes and information that you can access later on, this is the program for you. ','?'
'id: 9684 ',' Paid for the upgrade even tho I don  t really need it just to support the developers. ','?'
'id: 9684 ',' \\n\\nMy one complaint is you can  t print from it, but there are workarounds for that. ','?'
'id: 9690 ',' Only problem is that I need more security. ','?'
'id: 9690 ',' Doesn  t look like they are planning to do this. ','?'
'id: 9692 ',' The only complaint would be that it needs more options for font. ','?'
'id: 9701 ',' \\n\\nWould give it 5 stars except (IMO) the app needs a to integrate a calendar app into it. ','?'
'id: 9701 ',' I would jump on the premium plan in a heartbeat if that were available. ','?'
'id: 9702 ',' \\nThe local desktop version could be beefed up a bit to compete with OneNote. ','?'
'id: 9702 ',' Having notes available on all your devices are great. ','?'
'id: 9706 ',' I can take notes at work and school and have them available anywhere. ','?'
'id: 9707 ',' \\n\\nI like that EN added feature of Note Links, which are embedded links made on desktop yet readable nicely here. ','?'
'id: 9708 ',' I can take notes anywhere, on my phone or on my computer, and everything syncs and it just makes my life so much easier. ','?'
'id: 9708 ',' Now if I can just figure out how to move text message strings into Evernote it will be perfect , ','?'
'id: 9711 ',' So I can  t use Evernote. ','?'
'id: 9712 ',' I love that I can add graphics and sound. ','?'
'id: 9714 ',' Anything I need to keep track of I keep in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 9714 ',' I have it on my iPhone, but that  s mostly for access rather than creating notes. ','?'
'id: 9714 ',' I could go on and on about what it can do, but the shorter list would be what it can  t do. ','?'
'id: 9725 ',' I  m still learning how to make it work for me. ','?'
'id: 9725 ',' \\nI would rate it a 5, but it really, really needs font size adjustments in notes! ','?'
'id: 9726 ',' It is great when you have to grab and go to ER with them. ','?'
'id: 9726 ',' Highly recommend this application. ','?'
'id: 9727 ',' And, it  s not like some other apps, it solid and does not crash. ','?'
'id: 9732 ',' Wish interface were more sophisticated and needs more flexibility w/formatting the notes (e.g., making tables and choosing fonts/layout/smarter margins) would be great. ','?'
'id: 9735 ',' Does everything I need it to do and then some. ','?'
'id: 9738 ',' I don  t type as fast on my IPad virtual keyboard and I just like handwriting notes anyway. ','?'
'id: 9745 ',' I am so glad that a friend recommended it to me. ','?'
'id: 9746 ',' Second, they have to provide a satisfying experience (intuitive UI, easily repeatable, memorable processes, exceptional design). ','?'
'id: 9750 ',' No offline is a problem but beyond that great app , ','?'
'id: 9753 ',' This is a great app for taking notes and just writing down anything you want to remember. ','?'
'id: 9757 ',' Went back to the old notebook and deleted the copy didn  t need it there anymore, right? ','?'
'id: 9757 ',' \\n\\nHmmmm...just spent 45 minutes trying to get this up and running smoothly. ','?'
'id: 9766 ',' I use this for all my lists and for some reason, I like using  it more than the outlook task lists  I can use this and update it from my PC   It  s simply more appealing. ','?'
'id: 9772 ',' \\n\\nLack of offline search is an issue. ','?'
'id: 9773 ',' \\nThank you for making this available. ','?'
'id: 9778 ',' \\nWith all the excitement over Digital Paper and scanning docents into Evernote; I would like to see an image editor. ','?'
'id: 9781 ',' I can add photos and text. ','?'
'id: 9790 ',' Requires Internet connection to get at your notes with your phone, but a local copy is available for offline searching when using a laptop. ','?'
'id: 9790 ',' \\n\\nOn the iPhone it is a little cumbersome to scroll through long lists (like if you need to return to the top of the list to initiate a search), so organizing them well helps. ','?'
'id: 9791 ',' It needs to work on being integrated with some of the other browsers to avoid a daisy chain process to get items into Evernote, but once the information gets there it is easy to find, tag, search, organize. ','?'
'id: 9791 ',' Tags could use a word cloud function. ','?'
'id: 9794 ',' But now I have so much information which needed to be organized that I find Evernote is the perfect tool for managing projects , ','?'
'id: 9797 ',' Afterwards I try and open again and it asks to send a report, but then crashes. ','?'
'id: 9800 ',' I love being able to save data in one place and have it accessible when I need it. ','?'
'id: 9802 ',' When you have half a dozen jobs you have to be organized. ','?'
'id: 9805 ',' It is available on many platforms, and you can start using it right away. ','?'
'id: 9805 ',' But, there  s always something new you find you can do with it because of a good set of features. ','?'
'id: 9809 ',' I highly recommend this to anybody that needs to access information quickly. ','?'
'id: 9811 ',' It has made such a difference in my life. ','?'
'id: 9823 ',' Would be nice to have the option to change but there isn  t. It  s a goner. ','?'
'id: 9825 ',' I don  t think i know how to use it corr , ','?'
'id: 9827 ',' Sign up for their email to get ideas: this is THE indispensable app, and you need it on your laptop/desktop too. ','?'
'id: 9834 ',' Amazing what can be found in all he nooks and crannies of his program. ','?'
'id: 9841 ',' I  ve never had any problems with it though. ','?'
'id: 9841 ',' \\n\\nHighly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 9846 ',' Who are you to say that I need to change my password! ','?'
'id: 9846 ',' Especially since I was already creating a l o n g note. ','?'
'id: 9848 ',' It kept insisting I log into some account or create an account. ','?'
'id: 9848 ',' I have no desire to do either and I never could figure out how to bypass the startup login requirement and use it as a standalone note taking app. ','?'
'id: 9848 ',' \\n\\nEpic fail. ','?'
'id: 9852 ',' Good but notes are not available offline unless you favorite them which you cannot do on an ipad. ','?'
'id: 9859 ',' There are not enough font/formatting functions available. ','?'
'id: 9860 ',' I need to double up on Evernote and Google Drive to make it work the way I need it to. ','?'
'id: 9865 ',' I tip my hat to the rock star programmers who created it! ','?'
'id: 9867 ',' But I was finding I was still missing something. ','?'
'id: 9867 ',' Problem was when I  d have to try to go back and search for old notes from past meetings or projects. ','?'
'id: 9876 ',' The only aspect that I observe as lacking is the "source URL" feature as accessed through the iPhone; I cannot add the source URL from this device, but can do so easily from a PC or iPad. ','?'
'id: 9888 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 9896 ',' mischiefthecat ,  I use this app for so much, I HIGHLY recommend it and suggest to tag your notes and you  ll be able to retrieve so EASILY. ','?'
'id: 9899 ',' I simply create a notebook, and jot down my ideas. ','?'
'id: 9905 ',' \\n\\nMy only complaint is that I wish you could either 1) draw on the notes like you can in Notability, or 2) share files with Notability. ','?'
'id: 9907 ',' Whenever something pops into my head, I just create a new note so that I can remember it later. ','?'
'id: 9913 ',' I like this software, the only improvement that needs to happen is the bullets need a lot of work. ','?'
'id: 9915 ',' If I am reading a book and want to take notes I simply create a new notebook and make notes. ','?'
'id: 9915 ',' I just love this app! ','?'
'id: 9919 ',' There are endless uses for this app and I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 9923 ',' I recommend this. ','?'
'id: 9924 ',' When I need to copy and paste a lot of data to save on my Ipad, this is the app to use. ','?'
'id: 9930 ',' When you put them all together, the desktop, web and mobile apps are an impressive solution for just about any productivity challenge. ','?'
'id: 9933 ',' The software still crashes periodically on the IPAD, but nothing is ever lost. ','?'
'id: 9933 ',' That is a problem as I now use the IPAD as my primary portable comptuer. ','?'
'id: 9936 ',' Easy to use, and efficient, but it fails a lot on the iPad, especially when trying to take a note of a picture in your gallery. ','?'
'id: 9936 ',' Please fix this problem, I used to use Evernote on my phone for everything, but it keeps failing on my iPad, so it  s no fun anymore. ','?'
'id: 9936 ',' Also, the format could use some touch ups, or maybe just a complete make over. ','?'
'id: 9938 ',' My notes are always here, via wifi or 3G. ','?'
'id: 9949 ',' I Love this app and recommend it highly! ','?'
'id: 9950 ',' I am committed to learning how to use this. ','?'
'id: 9955 ',' I plan to expand my usage once I get yarn done. ','?'
'id: 9962 ',' I use it all the time, but in terms of appearance, it could use some personalization. ','?'
'id: 9964 ',' I can  t even look at my notes without being connected to the Internet anymore. ','?'
'id: 9966 ',' No reason the notes should be deleted during this process. ','?'
'id: 9967 ',' \\n\\nIf you  re looking for a really useful and very accessible way to take notes, write to do lists, etc. it doesn  t matter whether you are a student, business person, or a stay at home parent, this is your app. ','?'
'id: 9969 ',' \\n\\nOne thing I would love to see added is an outlining function. ','?'
'id: 9971 ',' I wish so much I could just tap and make it go away so I could access what I need to and be done! ','?'
'id: 9988 ',' I find that I need to use the shortest sync setting and switch to a "generic" note when I leave a computer/device so that I minimize the chance of conflicts occurring. ','?'
'id: 9990 ',' Then it would be the only app I would ever use for all things productivity. ','?'
'id: 9996 ',' \\n\\n2 things though: the app needs to open way faster. ','?'
'id: 9996 ',' \\n\\nAnd second, i really wish there was a way to pull out the documents I have in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10001 ',' This app is everything I need. ','?'
'id: 10013 ',' First app you should download with an iPad. ','?'
'id: 10015 ',' One can add photos to show one  s activities on a any day. ','?'
'id: 10028 ',' It has the features I need without being overwhelming. ','?'
'id: 10028 ',' I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 10033 ',' When I get something in the mail that I don  t need to act on right away, but I need to keep it, I scan it or take a picture and put it in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10042 ',' I  ve had Evernote since 2010 but just started REALLY using it as my lifestyle has demanded more idea capturing, journaling, and I have more devices now. ','?'
'id: 10051 ',' The issue is the navigation is just awful. ','?'
'id: 10053 ',' I just love it. ','?'
'id: 10059 ',' Abqaiq2 ,  You can create lists, keep track of and search items. ','?'
'id: 10059 ',' But the real power here is that this app as an engine could build a lot of solutions for things no one has thought of yet. ','?'
'id: 10061 ',' This fix would be helpful especially if you are typing notes and want to know the exact spot on a recoding to reference in playback. ','?'
'id: 10068 ',' I use it for everything I need to remember. ','?'
'id: 10070 ',' I used to just use the notebook app but then i discovered this gem. ','?'
'id: 10075 ',' Don  t need a complex folder/hierarchy structure (although you can create one if your mind works that way) and the search engine rocks. ','?'
'id: 10075 ',' Yes, for full use premium features have a annual subscription, but how much is your time wasted looking for that piece of paper worth? ','?'
'id: 10076 ',' If you  re an organizational freak like me   or if you just want one, paperless place to keep all of your ideas, this is the app for you. ','?'
'id: 10084 ',' We need handwriting to be converted, selectable and copiable as text. ','?'
'id: 10089 ',' I would give it 5 stars but I haven  t easily figured out how to delete notes from the app. ','?'
'id: 10094 ',' I like how you can use it on any mobile device as well as a PC or web browser. ','?'
'id: 10096 ',' Will take time to figure out how to use along with other productivity tools. ','?'
'id: 10100 ',' However, sometimes it fails to record what I have written just now so that I have to rewrite again. ','?'
'id: 10105 ',' Now, I can  t even sign in! ','?'
'id: 10107 ',' It would be even greater if I could use it at work but our computer security folk are back in the 50s. ','?'
'id: 10109 ',' It does everything &amp; anything I need! ','?'
'id: 10115 ',' Then you will get hooked on it like coffee! ','?'
'id: 10116 ',' Not really what I need. ','?'
'id: 10126 ',' Won  t it just be overwhelming and thus useless?" ','?'
'id: 10127 ',' \\n\\nI love the idea of being able to share my notebooks with messages or a printer, but why can  t I share to Facebook? ','?'
'id: 10129 ',' However this has been some major issue since I upgraded. ','?'
'id: 10129 ',' Also there is this constant "unknown error E3" that keeps happening and it just won  t sync. ','?'
'id: 10130 ',' After all these years you would expect to have right to left text support, RTL. ','?'
'id: 10130 ',' It has been request for many years but still not added to the product, although it is not that hard at all! ','?'
'id: 10131 ',' \\nIt just bothers me how Evernote takes so long to open. ','?'
'id: 10139 ',' And during the day I will check off all I have done and add all I plan to do. ','?'
'id: 10141 ',' I tried to log in tonight and it requested I reset my password for some reason. ','?'
'id: 10141 ',' OK here is the ridiculous part. ','?'
'id: 10141 ',' \\n\\nPlease, if you need me to reset my password, figure out a better way than this. ','?'
'id: 10147 ',' You have to register with Evernote to use this app. ','?'
'id: 10147 ',' You will also have to pay (upgrade your Evernote account to premium) to access your own content if you  re not online. ','?'
'id: 10150 ',' Just need a spreadsheet any then it would be perfect!! ','?'
'id: 10151 ',' A little bit of time needed to figure out the details. ','?'
'id: 10151 ',' Only wish it had better link options with iOS Calendar   I wind up just cutting &amp; pasting. ','?'
'id: 10154 ',' Really glad a friend recommended it! ','?'
'id: 10154 ',' I think it will probably be useful in the workplace once I graduate, as well. ','?'
'id: 10159 ',' Only downside is you have to pay monthly to be able to have a pin access , ','?'
'id: 10160 ',' Tools that are available in the app are fairly crude. ','?'
'id: 10160 ',' \\n\\nThe other thing that is sorely missing is the ability to have note templates. ','?'
'id: 10161 ',' Anything that I needed to keep in my pocket or briefcase now lives in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10163 ',' My business partner and I can access our lists, etc. and update them for each other. ','?'
'id: 10169 ',' I live how this app works, I remember things best using images and finally someone made this for people like me! ','?'
'id: 10175 ',' Although Evernote is indispensable, it needs some simple capabilities, such as word/letter count and clean HTML5 export. ','?'
'id: 10181 ',' This app was very good until it made you pay to take note offline in addition to the fee for buying the app. ','?'
'id: 10184 ',' It took too long to load and crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 10194 ',' My one suggestion to improve the "I can find anything ness" of the app would be not only be able to make a copy of a note in another notebook, but to have that note update the other versions of itself in additional notebooks whenever you update ANY version of it. ','?'
'id: 10199 ',' on my iPad Gen. 1) and wish it contained more full editing capabilities (I can  t find how to input a horizontal line). ','?'
'id: 10201 ',' It  s reliable, simple to use, and the ability to sync up everything to all my Apple Devices; it just provides a great ease of mind. ','?'
'id: 10218 ',' Please fix the syncing issue when audio/picture is embedded!!! ','?'
'id: 10231 ',' Love the way I can use any of my devices and always my notes handy to review. ','?'
'id: 10239 ',' I  m learning how to use it, but so far I like it. ','?'
'id: 10239 ',' Everyone who loves having everything at their fingertips should have this. ','?'
'id: 10246 ',' If anyone gives me a piece if paper Ina meeting I scan it then recycle. ','?'
'id: 10251 ',' To fully utilize I recommend also downloading it to all computers you use. ','?'
'id: 10256 ',' I use it for everything from grocery lists to keeping a record of things i need to reference while transcribing the current deposition i am working on. ','?'
'id: 10256 ',' Thanks Evernote team for this most excellent app and for all the other great apps you have developed, especially EverClip for the iPad; i use the Mac version and am happy to see it added to the iPad. ','?'
'id: 10257 ',' Does everything you need it to do. ','?'
'id: 10258 ',' Let me type message bubbles right onto PDF  s like you can in the Kindle reader so you can make notes or retain critical thoughts when you  re reading. ','?'
'id: 10261 ',' Unfortunately, the features that Evernote has on its monthly subscription can be found in other apps for a "one" time fee  rather than a monthly one. ','?'
'id: 10264 ',' How many times will you guys have to fix this app. ','?'
'id: 10264 ',' I understand that you need to test these updates etc. but please release them after ALL THE BUGS? ','?'
'id: 10267 ',' \\n\\nAlso, there are some small issues that keep me from rating the app higher:\\n\\n1. ','?'
'id: 10267 ',' This is not an issue on my iPad, but this is not efficient on my iPad Mini. ','?'
'id: 10267 ',' Please use all available screen real estate. ','?'
'id: 10267 ',' This is generally an issue for all iPad Mini apps, but it  s particularly egregious here. ','?'
'id: 10267 ',' The app crashed when I reopened my iPad and I lost 8 hours worth of notes. ','?'
'id: 10268 ',' Adding pictures and sound is a plus. ','?'
'id: 10278 ',' It could only be better, if it could be converted to google doc format, for printing. ','?'
'id: 10281 ',' Cleaning of my desk at work is super easy, I just snap pics of any loose notes/paper and tag it in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10281 ',' Shared notebooks are awesome for side projects too, but are only available with a premium acct. ','?'
'id: 10285 ',' It is fast and the web clipper is great ( just discovered the clipper for my iPad). ','?'
'id: 10289 ',' I looked it up and others have the same problem. ','?'
'id: 10292 ',' It  ll be great if a pen writing like penultimate could be incorporated into it. ','?'
'id: 10293 ',' Getting info transferred between 2 iPhones, iPad &amp; computer   Works like you would expect it to , ','?'
'id: 10307 ',' You never have to remover details again as everything is filed in a searchable repository. ','?'
'id: 10310 ',' Love it, but nothing  is perfect right? ','?'
'id: 10311 ',' Even when the app crashes, most of my data is already saved! ','?'
'id: 10315 ',' I can see everything I need and sort however I want! ','?'
'id: 10317 ',' Highly recommended due to it  s ease of use and flexibility...my information is available everywhere, anytime I need it. ','?'
'id: 10317 ',' I even photographed the back of the combo locks at the gym so I won  t forget the combination. ','?'
'id: 10318 ',' In each run, the program will crash. ','?'
'id: 10321 ',' I have issues and been unsuccessful to get them resolved. ','?'
'id: 10328 ',' Please make the audio from recording better in quality. ','?'
'id: 10334 ',' I find myself looking up online how to do the things I want done. ','?'
'id: 10335 ',' \\n\\nIt  s flexible for all that because of its tags and folders and its constant sync means I can add something to the tag for my BF "to read" and he  ll have access right away. ','?'
'id: 10335 ',' I can use its "email into Evernote" feature to send my medication, asthma, migraine and other records from other apps to my medical folder, which I can then share with my doctors! ','?'
'id: 10335 ',' \\n\\nI really recommend Evernote  you don  t lose anything to try. ','?'
'id: 10335 ',' \\n\\nI also suggest you check out Feedly or Newsify; "Everyday.me" (a diary app that saves/syncs your Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, and Foursquare posts to weekly EN notes (and any app posts plus any you email in to it); Evernote Food (now you can add all your recipes!) ','?'
'id: 10338 ',' Syncs seamlessly,  and there is never a problem. ','?'
'id: 10340 ',' Oh what I was missing. ','?'
'id: 10342 ',' Hey, here  s an idea: Evernote, acquire the Audionotes App. ','?'
'id: 10344 ',' I recommend it to everyone. ','?'
'id: 10346 ',' How did I ever live without it? ','?'
'id: 10356 ',' I use it almost everyday, taking down ideas at any time so I never worried I will forget them as before. ','?'
'id: 10366 ',' The only thing I would love to see Evernote doing is adding a choice for videos. ','?'
'id: 10367 ',' Does everything I need it to. ','?'
'id: 10374 ',' It just needs the ability to move and group folders and notes within the app. ','?'
'id: 10376 ',' If you  re a student or just someone who deals with a lot information you need Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10382 ',' \\nI can also email a document to my evernote and have it available for meetings. ','?'
'id: 10382 ',' If I get to a meeting and need a different  document, I can call the office and have someone email it to my evernote account. ','?'
'id: 10382 ',' I recommend it to everyone who needs information or reports. ','?'
'id: 10383 ',' Although it has some formatting issues compared with the website/desktop apps, I can overlook them. ','?'
'id: 10390 ',' Has made me a much more productive (and happy) individual. ','?'
'id: 10391 ',' Sure, it takes some work on your part to sort it all out but you have to get it in one place first. ','?'
'id: 10392 ',' When going to a hyperlink, you must tap the document a few times to get back to the document browsing. ','?'
'id: 10401 ',' \\n\\nNow, since you insisted on feedback, here are a couple of things to improve:\\nSync   why do you get so many errors, and seem confused about syncing? ','?'
'id: 10402 ',' I love that it  s available on every major platform. ','?'
'id: 10405 ',' Well, if I typed them up on here, then I  ll always have them so that  s not a problem. ','?'
'id: 10407 ',' Using Evernote just gets better and better for me. ','?'
'id: 10418 ',' It is instructions on how to combine your usage of email and Evernote to create a GTD system ("Getting Things Done" by David Allen). ','?'
'id: 10427 ',' There are numerous resources available for you to learn different ways people implement an Evernote system in their lives, take some time and develop a system that you like. ','?'
'id: 10440 ',' This does all I need it to, does it well, reliably, and keeps me SYNCHED. ','?'
'id: 10440 ',' I can just write and keep   all kinds of notes with a simple intuitive interface that doesn  t need to be   learned  . ','?'
'id: 10443 ',' If evernote provided this feature it would deserve 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 10443 ',' The app still needs calendar integration and a better approach to task lists and reminders. ','?'
'id: 10446 ',' All my devices are synced and I have access to notes when I need them  . ','?'
'id: 10446 ',' \\n\\nThe latest version of Evernote for iPad and iPhone is excellent and has all the flexibility and note taking capability I need , ','?'
'id: 10450 ',' \\nI like the fact that I can create bullet points, numbering etc. \\nI had a 4 hour seminar that I took notes on via my IPhone and was able to email them out to my team immediately after because they looked proffessional and were ready to go. ','?'
'id: 10451 ',' It  s probably a 5 star app when it  s not crashing. ','?'
'id: 10451 ',' Something, perhaps a recent update, is causing it to crash repeatedly upon opening. ','?'
'id: 10451 ',' For several days I have not been able to access the app on my iPad; it works fine on my phone. ','?'
'id: 10451 ',' \\n\\nPlease fix this issue and I will update my rating. ','?'
'id: 10451 ',' There  s not much worse than a fantastic app that you just can  t use. ','?'
'id: 10452 ',' A friend recommended this app. ','?'
'id: 10452 ',' If you are a writer and have multiple work stations; Or maybe you just spend your time taking notes on your mobile and would like to compile those thoughts into a coherent story on your desktop or laptop computer. ','?'
'id: 10456 ',' I can use it for anything and I do! ','?'
'id: 10461 ',' \\n\\nThe more info I gather the more I think Evernote needs a passcode to access this data. ','?'
'id: 10477 ',' If I forget my iPad, or it dies, I can just whip out the phone and continue taking notes or studying, no hassle. ','?'
'id: 10482 ',' So happy to be able to categorize notes I need to find! ','?'
'id: 10487 ',' now that I  ve discovered how to use it. ','?'
'id: 10490 ',' There are a few functions on the desktop or web based versions that are either missing in the app or I simply don  t know how to leverage them in the app (I  m not going to hold my ignorance against a rating, so I will keep the app rating at 5 stars, as it is really fantastic). ','?'
'id: 10494 ',' I do like this one better also because you can have as many notebook as you need to stay organized. ','?'
'id: 10498 ',' It created a difficult situation. ','?'
'id: 10498 ',' However, on the plus side it never seems to loose data when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 10498 ',' \\n2) I would love to see more editing and formatting capabilities\\n3) I am not sure the developers have a precise vision of what the primary purpose of the product is. ','?'
'id: 10498 ',' (To me they do not do a great job in describing all it can do either.) ','?'
'id: 10498 ',' Do not feel Evernote does good job in explaining features. ','?'
'id: 10505 ',' It  s amazing, and meant that when my laptop crashed I still had access to all my important files on other devices. ','?'
'id: 10509 ',' Usually great but I just lost a really long email that will be difficult to re write. ','?'
'id: 10511 ',' I was messing around and made a few random notes but the Tried to delete it but couldn  t , ','?'
'id: 10515 ',' I keep recipes and can set up my iPad in the kitchen instead of my clunky, bigger laptop, I have a Tech Tips folder for help references related to my devices, a Yard and Garden folder that allows me access when I  m out at the garden center and I can  t recall how much mulch I need, it  s at my fingertips on my phone. ','?'
'id: 10518 ',' Why annoy your users and waste good will for something that would be so easy? ','?'
'id: 10521 ',' I can attach files such as outlines and entire manuscripts, and have them available on any of my devices without having to export, sync or otherwise transport. ','?'
'id: 10522 ',' This is a known issue that Evernote refuses to address apparently. ','?'
'id: 10523 ',' The mac version crashes more than i would like, but they fix it pretty quickly with an update. ','?'
'id: 10523 ',' \\n\\nKeep making it better, please. ','?'
'id: 10540 ',' I wish I could use different color fonts/highlights on the iPad app though. ','?'
'id: 10542 ',' Before anyone considers purchasing this app, I suggest that you do a google search first to consider the issue(s) by users on the evernote forums. ','?'
'id: 10542 ',' And, I have not been able to access any of my Evernote info for weeks. ','?'
'id: 10542 ',' They are, especially, having issues syncing pics. ','?'
'id: 10545 ',' This is a great tool for typing in but when you tell it to fix a word it will fix it but get rid of the space between it and the previous word so you have to go add it back in. ','?'
'id: 10550 ',' However, is there any functionality that would allow me to mark any of my notes as a task and push it to my task list? ','?'
'id: 10561 ',' I might not have the need for that much note taking but I truly enjoy using Evernote and exploring all the features! ','?'
'id: 10566 ',' I did not give it 5 stars because there are occasional UI issues when inputting text directly into a note, especially when using task boxes, and I  d like to see other UI improvements. ','?'
'id: 10567 ',' I upgraded to the premium to get access to all docs off line, but it is not working as expected. ','?'
'id: 10568 ',' \\n\\nHowever, now my password expired and the link to reset my password that was sent to my email requires a current password, which is "expired" and registers as invalid. ','?'
'id: 10569 ',' If I can write email and have it synch later, or if the apps store now serves updates without a login, why waste my time? ','?'
'id: 10576 ',' Covers everything I need it to do and the price is right! ','?'
'id: 10576 ',' The best parts are that it works across all my devices and will work offline once the data is transferred just once. ','?'
'id: 10577 ',' I would like to see more text formatting capabilities especially choosing font and size. ','?'
'id: 10586 ',' Therefore, I can refer to my documents where ever I happen to be, when I need the info. ','?'
'id: 10586 ',' \\nThis is one app I recommend for everyone. ','?'
'id: 10590 ',' I had originally made this app accessible to over a hundred employees,students, and clients, but to no possible positive outcome. ','?'
'id: 10590 ',' My clients cannot listen to audio notes nor can they read any class notes available unless they are online. ','?'
'id: 10593 ',' But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync. ','?'
'id: 10596 ',' I love how it has   posteds   that you can use with a pucture within it! ','?'
'id: 10597 ',' They need to improve text editing on the app. ','?'
'id: 10598 ',' I  m always thinking and this is here for whenever I need to jot things down , ','?'
'id: 10605 ',' Then when you need to retrieve information you have to remember your file folder hierarchy. ','?'
'id: 10605 ',' Evernote allows you to electronically store all forms of information whether you choose to put them into tags or notebooks or just leave them all unfiled; The search feature is robust and will help you find what you  re looking for very quickly. ','?'
'id: 10607 ',' If you take notes and work at a job you need this app. ','?'
'id: 10608 ',' \\n\\nThe flexibility it provides to capture and access information is amazing! ','?'
'id: 10609 ',' I enjoy most the wireless synchronization of my notes so I can use them wherever I go. ','?'
'id: 10609 ',' Also, I can use multiple folders for different topics. ','?'
'id: 10611 ',' \\n\\nIt also allows me to take notes   adding photos of the documents handed out at the meetings so that I have everything in one place \\n\\nI travel all of the time so this is very helpful , ','?'
'id: 10612 ',' You can actually run your life with it. ','?'
'id: 10616 ',' If you do not have and USE this free app on a regular basis, you are missing out on a genuine app gold mine. ','?'
'id: 10616 ',' \\n\\nI have no connection with Evernote in any way other than being extremely grateful that the app is available for my personal use. ','?'
'id: 10627 ',' App looked good but have had following difficulties:\\nunable to synch/connect with Evernote servers for days at a time\\nloss of information I typed in\\n\\nIt is a good idea, will look at it in another year   can  t afford to lose information. ','?'
'id: 10629 ',' Evernote is great for keeping all my thought processes in one place and organized the way I need them. ','?'
'id: 10633 ',' So incredibly useful  everyone please upgrade to premium if you possibly can. ','?'
'id: 10633 ',' Evernote is so worth it, and we need to support this great app! ','?'
'id: 10635 ',' Still learning how to use it, but I have found it to be extremely convenient and useful. ','?'
'id: 10636 ',' Useless since that is my problem. ','?'
'id: 10637 ',' As they update it it gets worse. ','?'
'id: 10639 ',' I Love that you can take an entire article and store it in a notebook for reference, pictures and all! ','?'
'id: 10640 ',' DrMatthewDunn ,  The more i use Evernote the more I use Evernote and the less I forget, misplace, duplicate, fail to get value from and most of all the less I stress over personal info overload. ','?'
'id: 10653 ',' Now I just need to figure out how to work it on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 10655 ',' After a couple of weeks, You will wonder how you ever were able to live without it. ','?'
'id: 10658 ',' I can add my own pictures or images that I like from other sources. ','?'
'id: 10658 ',' My phone and laptop are password protected, so privacy is not an issue. ','?'
'id: 10659 ',' Some people need the visual division of  each separate line. ','?'
'id: 10663 ',' I love that you can bold, underline, make checklists and use bullets, etc, keeps me very organized. ','?'
'id: 10664 ',' I have now been able to go paperless, have any information I need anytime/anywhere which has made me more organized and efficient both in my personal and professional life. ','?'
'id: 10664 ',' It took me a little bit to get used to the format and sometimes the system crashes for some reason, but my information is never lost and the positive impact outlays the occasional glitch. ','?'
'id: 10667 ',' It doesn  t save it locally, or make any kind of effort to let me know it just threw away all my data. ','?'
'id: 10671 ',' But like any other tool, you need to use it well and consistently. ','?'
'id: 10679 ',' It also provides an easily searchable archive for notes to reduce the paper clutter in your pocket or in the filing cabinet. ','?'
'id: 10682 ',' I recommend this to any note taker. ','?'
'id: 10684 ',' It  s got so much that the iPad Notes doesn  t. You can sort your notes into folders, format the text, and it  s all synched  through my devices through the Evernote cloud. ','?'
'id: 10687 ',' The interface needs to be like the mac version, or at least we should have the option!! ','?'
'id: 10688 ',' \\n\\nWhen I need info urgently or to take a note quickly it  s usually when I have just my iPhone. ','?'
'id: 10696 ',' A place to put my random notes and make sense of it all when I need them. ','?'
'id: 10700 ',' I use this app everyday for any thoughts I need to write down or as a quick notepad and best of all it syncs to all my devices at once when I make notes , ','?'
'id: 10702 ',' Accessible from desk top &amp; mobile device, an interesting solution to keeping data available &amp; organized. ','?'
'id: 10704 ',' I  ve only been using it for 10 days or so, and already it  s come in very handy for accessing information where and when I needed it! ','?'
'id: 10707 ',' I highly recommend searching for online video tutorials about the ap as there are some good ones that help explain the powerful little elephant called Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10708 ',' However, once I got the iPad 4, I just found the Evernote to be so much better than the notepad. ','?'
'id: 10708 ',' You can easily format how you want your notes to look, in terms of letter colors, lists, or paragraphs. ','?'
'id: 10710 ',' Evernote has become my most used app; using it to plan and organize everything. ','?'
'id: 10711 ',' I have used other apps in the past which crashed, lacked options or were not stable. ','?'
'id: 10716 ',' I like that I can add notes on whatever device I  m using and they  ll appear on all my devices. ','?'
'id: 10718 ',' Uhm...it crashed and my notebook is gone along with over 100 notes. ','?'
'id: 10722 ',' I would like to see more editing functionality with cropping and rotating photos. ','?'
'id: 10723 ',' Wish there were easier options for sorting notes after they have been written, but I could be missing something. ','?'
'id: 10723 ',' If you have an iPad you need this app. ','?'
'id: 10726 ',' Great for cross platform users who need to store important information for later recall. ','?'
'id: 10744 ',' With so many different lists, ideas, plans, events, etc, in life  Evernote provides a way to keep it all together(but does even more than that). ','?'
'id: 10745 ',' One suggestion: just like when you have the option of adding an existing picture or taking a new one it would be nice to insert an existing recording. ','?'
'id: 10747 ',' Just, get it. ','?'
'id: 10755 ',' I recommend getting the paid verson. ','?'
'id: 10756 ',' I can  t use something that isn  t reliable. ','?'
'id: 10761 ',' I recommend this app to anyone! ','?'
'id: 10763 ',' I never thought this would be as useful as it is. ','?'
'id: 10781 ',' I hate how hard iris to put different notes into different notebooks, though! ','?'
'id: 10785 ',' \\nSure, I took a quick look and could see you could sync with the cloud, use tags, etc., but I  m one of those people who needs a significant bump in productivity. ','?'
'id: 10785 ',' \\nThe only 2 things I can think of that should be added are i) ability to zoom when taking a photo, and  ii) add video to notes. ','?'
'id: 10788 ',' Quite often the sync with the server fails and it ends up uploading multiple copies if the same note. ','?'
'id: 10791 ',' This is very useful to keep your personal information in one place, it don  t matter how many devices you have all you have to do is log in! ','?'
'id: 10792 ',' Great app, I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 10792 ',' I like the feature that lets you add check boxes and I like that you can change wether the font is italicized, bold, or underlined. ','?'
'id: 10794 ',' wish Evernote had the built in Task Management of an app like Easy To Do so I wouldn  t have to use 2 apps. ','?'
'id: 10798 ',' Adding pictures is a great feature and web clips but I don  t use the audio feature but I can see where it might be useful. ','?'
'id: 10798 ',' When that gets added this will be the most complete and by far the best. ','?'
'id: 10799 ',' I wish I can use every feature offline though , ','?'
'id: 10801 ',' I  d like to see more functions built into the app to make it more like the desktop application. ','?'
'id: 10801 ',' Nice that you can now create notebooks from the iPad app, but additional text formatting options  such as font color, size, and adding the horizontal line   would be great. ','?'
'id: 10801 ',' \\n\\nOne issue I  ve see recur periodically is that, when editing a note sometimes the formatting toolbar doesn  t show up until I have closed and reopened the note multiple times. ','?'
'id: 10805 ',' Once I figured out how many different things I could use it for, I wonder how I  ve done without it. ','?'
'id: 10807 ',' Works for what I need , ','?'
'id: 10822 ',' Just love it. ','?'
'id: 10823 ',' Guess I need to check out GoogleDocs. ','?'
'id: 10825 ',' Pros\\nOverall very smooth adding notes, notebooks, organizing notes\\nSyncing works excellent. ','?'
'id: 10828 ',' Keeps everything I need all in one place so I can access it anywhere. ','?'
'id: 10846 ',' This would allow users to choose which account to send the email from. ','?'
'id: 10846 ',' Also, would be nice to be able to track who I  ve sent notes to. ','?'
'id: 10847 ',' Why do developers kill their own apps? ','?'
'id: 10847 ',' \\n\\nPlus I read here many are having sync problems since the update. ','?'
'id: 10847 ',' \\n\\nupdate: I sure wish there was a way to lower a one star review. ','?'
'id: 10847 ',' \\n\\nNow search doesnt work at all, it just hangs the program. ','?'
'id: 10847 ',' \\nI am done, I am out, I am signing up for Keep after years with evernote, as soon as a developer ports it to IOs or creates a syncher I will uninstall the product. ','?'
'id: 10848 ',' I  d love to be able to use bands of highlighting rather than just color the letters. ','?'
'id: 10849 ',' As a professional photographer and entertainment production consultant, I need to be fully functional while mobile. ','?'
'id: 10849 ',' \\n\\nI rated a 4 instead of a 5 only because Evernote needs to catch up with iOS functionality. ','?'
'id: 10849 ',' Just Google Evernote iOS web capture. ','?'
'id: 10856 ',' Check out TheSecretWeapon.org for ideas on how to set up your Evernote to stay organized. ','?'
'id: 10858 ',' The only issues I have had are of style not function. ','?'
'id: 10861 ',' Never had any problems. ','?'
'id: 10867 ',' Being able to take photos through the app and have it upload it to a note instantly where I can then add a description to share on the spot with collaborators is priceless. ','?'
'id: 10868 ',' The others keep crashing and delete your notes or get so fancy and hook up to facebook you can  t figure out how to use. ','?'
'id: 10869 ',' It would be nice to have offline access to notebooks in the free version, but I can  t really complain because it  s free. ','?'
'id: 10871 ',' I highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 10873 ',' Now all of this information is literally at my fingertips and perfectly legible and they  re available on every device I own updated continually. ','?'
'id: 10873 ',' At first this scared me a little, I thought to myself how does this thing know I  m in a meeting in Cleveland ? ','?'
'id: 10873 ',' In fact, if I don  t know the address of where I am, I just initiated a note and it tells me! ','?'
'id: 10894 ',' An idea, research topic, work call, grocery list, whatever I need to jot down and refer to later, I keep it in Evernote. ','?'
'id: 10894 ',' For the system to work, you have to trust it. ','?'
'id: 10894 ',' I  m trust Evernote; it  s always where I need it to be and I can search my entire data base for just the word I need. ','?'
'id: 10899 ',' I just wish there was more info on how to take advantage of the many functions that I haven  t discovered yet. ','?'
'id: 10902 ',' They need to get up to date with a tablet and Evernote\\n\\nPaperboy40 , ','?'
'id: 10903 ',' It is great knowing I can add info in any computer and have it automatically sync on all computers. ','?'
'id: 10903 ',' \\n\\nI do wish I could download a backup file that could easily be used  to replace the database if required, but other than that, I can  t think of any improvements. ','?'
'id: 10906 ',' It  ll just suddenly go to another note page and just lost at least two of me voice notes and I kind of need those. ','?'
'id: 10907 ',' Does everything I need and so much more. ','?'
'id: 10911 ',' I always get synchronization errors. ','?'
'id: 10911 ',' When it runs out of uploading space, instead of ask you if you want to buy more storage of wait until next month, it just crashes. ','?'
'id: 10912 ',' Frequently crashes and does not allow local storage of personal notes, which are automatically stored on painfully slow Evernote servers. ','?'
'id: 10912 ',' Hope you did not have anything sensitive in your notes! ','?'
'id: 10913 ',' This is a huge problem for me because as a chef, my recipes are my livelihood. ','?'
'id: 10922 ',' This time I  m almost exclusively using it just for the notetaking capability. ','?'
'id: 10922 ',' I can then cut and paste directly into other documents that I need or corporate email. ','?'
'id: 10922 ',' I recommended Evernote to almost everyone I know. ','?'
'id: 10923 ',' Just get it. ','?'
'id: 10932 ',' I updated it and lost all of them. ','?'
'id: 10933 ',' It  s easy to find the recipe I need. ','?'
'id: 10933 ',' I can add notes and photos. ','?'
'id: 10934 ',' Just download this app and let the love begin , ','?'
'id: 10938 ',' \\n\\nHighly recommend this app and the service at large. ','?'
'id: 10940 ',' What really got me using it is a medical issue. ','?'
'id: 10940 ',' If I need to research a surgeon, well, start copying the information into the notebook. ','?'
'id: 10940 ',' All of the information is available on my Ipad, computer, blackberry. ','?'
'id: 10940 ',' How to use it isn  t immediately obvious and for what purposes, so take your time and play with it. ','?'
'id: 10943 ',' Soon after, I deleted the other note taking apps and stared downloading the ecosystem of apps that support Evernote integration. ','?'
'id: 10957 ',' Because the app was great up until this point, I would have continued to use it as long as they reassured me this glitch had been fixed. ','?'
'id: 10958 ',' I use this app daily and recommend it to all my friends. ','?'
'id: 10963 ',' And what is even better is the fact that you can access all your notes when ever, where ever  you are as long as you log on and synchronize. ','?'
'id: 10969 ',' You must download this app right meow. ','?'
'id: 10971 ',' Great note application, I just love the app, makes my life easy. ','?'
'id: 10978 ',' Everyone should have chance to keep a lot of things. ','?'
'id: 10989 ',' I keep everything in it and never have to search for information like kid  s info, house details or business cards. ','?'
'id: 10997 ',' My only problem is the lack of sync with PDF editing programs like GoodReader or in app PDF editing. ','?'
'id: 11007 ',' Highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 11009 ',' Problem with most note taking apps is that they aren  t versatile enough to use all the time. ','?'
'id: 11015 ',' the mobile version is quirky and needs improvements. ','?'
'id: 11015 ',' The online version really needs better text and photo editing capability. ','?'
'id: 11022 ',' Since then, Evernote forgets my password   ID combination about once a day. ','?'
'id: 11028 ',' I think the highlighting capability needs to be added, but other than that I think it  s great! ','?'
'id: 11037 ',' \\n\\nthe iPhone and Mac/PC desktop versions of Evernote need to have OCR (Optical Character Recognition) that can be copied/pasted. ','?'
'id: 11039 ',' There seems to be so much you can use it for. ','?'
'id: 11039 ',' I recommend it to at least one person a week   usually strangers at the grocery store! ','?'
'id: 11040 ',' \\nMy only quibble is it crashes sometimes when it is sharing a new note across devices. ','?'
'id: 11040 ',' It  s good about opening back up right where it crashed, but it  s still a hassle. ','?'
'id: 11045 ',' I would use Word for home notes, but I prefer the way Evernote easily organizes the notes. ','?'
'id: 11045 ',' I have never had any problems sending notes via email  in fact, they are received instantly. ','?'
'id: 11047 ',' I needed an app that I could sync across my iPad, iPhone, work laptop and home laptop. ','?'
'id: 11047 ',' My company is strict about the apps they allow on the laptop so the web based option is a perfect solution. ','?'
'id: 11049 ',' This was the App I was looking for to organize my life. ','?'
'id: 11059 ',' Sometimes I forget the voice record on and I can  t cut the time I record nothing without deleting everything. ','?'
'id: 11059 ',' And if we could use it whenever we want, after recording any time. ','?'
'id: 11063 ',' Also the ability to access from my PC, my I pad and my phone allows me to access it all from wherever I am, whenever I need it. ','?'
'id: 11065 ',' If I could only have one app on my iPhone &amp; iPad, it would be Evernote. ','?'
'id: 11069 ',' It still needs some editing and organizing tools that the online/desktop has. ','?'
'id: 11070 ',' PLUS, you now have to change your password every so often which I do not want to be forced to do. ','?'
'id: 11078 ',' \\n\\nThe search function needs to improve as it often won  t pick up things. ','?'
'id: 11080 ',' I  d suggest organizing your notes by titling them their date   then it  s clear what you  re looking for. ','?'
'id: 11081 ',' Do not hesitate. ','?'
'id: 11085 ',' Get the web clipper (and do a web search for how to install it on your iPhone). ','?'
'id: 11093 ',' My only gripe is that currently you cannot nest folders inside folders. ','?'
'id: 11094 ',' Evernote is an app that needs to be used all the time to be appreciated. ','?'
'id: 11095 ',' Does everything I need it to especially for writing in journals. ','?'
'id: 11096 ',' Notes feature is great but strange that i have to log into account to delete old notes and cannot do that with a single swipe in the app itself. ','?'
'id: 11101 ',' Each note becomes like a separate entity that you then can attach other things to, such as locations, photos, etc. ','?'
'id: 11102 ',' I sometimes try to go back to paper notes and it just doesn  t work because I won  t have paper or pen some time when I need it, but I always have my phone on me! ','?'
'id: 11103 ',' I love how you can easily organize notes, and even search texts in pictures , ','?'
'id: 11113 ',' \\n\\nMy only issue is that I feel there could be a more intuitive way to easily organize notes into notebooks. ','?'
'id: 11114 ',' It works but it needs font control. ','?'
'id: 11116 ',' I haven  t read the GTD book, but have implemented the "secret weapon" tags somewhat successfully and added one for "quick things" that I can do in less than 5 minutes. ','?'
'id: 11124 ',' That  s all that needs to be said. ','?'
'id: 11133 ',' So far, it does everything I need! ','?'
'id: 11134 ',' Commit to Evernote and it will work for you. ','?'
'id: 11137 ',' I am self employed, and therefore need to be on top of my job at all times. ','?'
'id: 11137 ',' I  m now regaining some confidence that what I  m doing is right! ','?'
'id: 11141 ',' If there is a problem, they will fix it. ','?'
'id: 11145 ',' I would love to use at least some of these, but they cost too much for the casual user. ','?'
'id: 11145 ',' I get that they need to monetize their business, but I think they need a price point somewhere between free and where they are now to get me in. ','?'
'id: 11145 ',' I would suggest perhaps a less robust feature set and charge a one time fee for the app, leaving the remainder of the premium services to the power users. ','?'
'id: 11147 ',' OneNote just stores the file   so it is one click to open it. ','?'

'id: 12669 ',' I recommend it often. ','?'
'id: 12682 ',' I spend hours just looking and getting great ideas! ','?'
'id: 12685 ',' ;) I think it could be better by being able to private message someone , though you could block the person from messaging if needed. ','?'
'id: 12685 ',' Also I think it could be better if a pin could be deleted from your group board (like for example if it was inappropriate and you didn  t want it on your board), and also if you didn  t need to follow a person back for them to be added to a group board. ','?'

'id: 12810 ',' Never had the problem before. ','?'
'id: 12838 ',' The only suggestions...fix the glitch that boots you out and shuts down your iPad on occasion, create main topic board to house boards as subtopics (e.g. Main topic "decorating" and boards under this would be kitchen, bedroom, etc.) I just have so many boards it would make things more organized and easier to find. ','?'
'id: 12851 ',' I don  t understand why fix something that is not broken to really break it!!? ','?'
'id: 12856 ',' My sister convinced my to start pinning and now I can  t stop! ','?'

'id: 13003 ',' Overall it is fun &amp;   provides a lot of good info. ','?'
'id: 13005 ',' The only bad thing about it is that you can  t get on it without wifi. ','?'

'id: 13033 ',' I have to careful when I open it because it can be hours before I come up for air. ','?'
'id: 13052 ',' Please take off the new update where it recommends sending certain pins to people who may like it on your Facebook friends list. ','?'

'id: 13300 ',' Then there was this last update :( Now iPad wants to crash sometimes, not anywhere like before but just some. ','?'
'id: 13300 ',' And you know it would be great to be able to have more than  350 boards, I have noticed some of the people I follow have more but I can  t figure out how to do it! ','?'
'id: 13300 ',' If we could just solve these issues it would be awesome! ','?'
'id: 13308 ',' The only improvement I suggest is to add the ability to "zoom" in on the pictures after they have been pinned. ','?'
'id: 13316 ',' I have had the iPhone 4S and 5s, with both of them I had loading issues when saving an image that would freeze and continue to load hours after I have exited the app. ','?'

'id: 13403 ',' I can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 13407 ',' The only problem is I spend too much time on it. ','?'
'id: 13415 ',' The only complaint I can share is I tried a recipe that had three ingredients, followed the recipe completely and failed all three times. ','?'
'id: 13416 ',' Very infrequently do I have any problems and it is so convenient. ','?'
'id: 13418 ',' Honestly, I  m not sure I like the latest update but I will either adjust or they will update it again. ','?'

'id: 13476 ',' This app needs an update. ','?'
'id: 13480 ',' Don  t listen to anybody who gave them one star they are just mad because they didn  t get any followers. ','?'
'id: 13485 ',' The way I think is to categorize first and then comment...but once you select a category you  ve pinned it and then you must do the several step process of editing. ','?'
'id: 13492 ',' It helps me keep track of my pins and makes the easy to find when I need them. ','?'
'id: 13495 ',' When I try to pin from Facebook, half the time it tells me I need to log in first. ','?'
'id: 13495 ',' So sometimes I just skip it and email the item to myself. ','?'
'id: 13496 ',' I was nvr a big Facebook fan bc it gave too much personal without any personality   Pinterest let  s your real self shine through whether you intended to or not ;)\\nI just wish that with the update that they would fix the crashing of my iPad if I have too many windows open or I have left it open too long :( , ','?'

'id: 13798 ',' Decks for the backyard was really fun when we were planning our backyard update. ','?'
'id: 13803 ',' The only thing I would love added to Pinterest overall is keywords because a lot of times the captions for the pin do not contain any information about what the pin is about and then there is no way to search for it. ','?'
'id: 13812 ',' I love this site but the app crashes every time I use it :( , ','?'
'id: 13818 ',' Great thing, just need more money , ','?'
'id: 13820 ',' Is there any way of getting the last version back, otherwise please change it!? ','?'
'id: 13824 ',' The only problem is the newest update makes if a bit difficult to find and like things. ','?'
'id: 13826 ',' The update crashes sometimes, but not as much as it used to. ','?'
'id: 13838 ',' It  s so much more convenient and clear here. ','?'
'id: 13840 ',' A few updates ago this thing was added where whnevr you pinned something you would have to hold your finger on the screen and slide it. ','?'

'id: 13850 ',' I have been hoping for a new version to fix the issue. ','?'
'id: 13874 ',' Pinterest has made my life so much easier! ','?'
'id: 13882 ',' The only thing I would like to see added is a "find" feature for every board considering how many pins I have now. ','?'
'id: 13892 ',' When I need to find something Pinterest is my first stop , ','?'
'id: 13896 ',' Could add feature that loads more pins when you reach the bottom and run out of pins!!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 13898 ',' Wish it didn  t crash on occasion but other than that, it  s great! ','?'
'id: 13928 ',' The down side is that it does indeed crash on you everyonce in a while, not constant at all and doesn  t pick up where you left off, and you will be lucky if you find that specific pin again. ','?'
'id: 13928 ',' Just remember that it  s probably a good idea to try some things out and see if you like them, if not you can delete it off. ','?'
'id: 13931 ',' I pick up some great ideas, crazy photos, and so on, but occasionally it just puts up colored boxes instead of photos. ','?'
'id: 13931 ',' When I posted one image to FB, any time anyone clicked on it, it went to Pinterest without a way back to FB, so I deleted it. ','?'

'id: 14351 ',' Has everything I need plus more amazing app!! ','?'
'id: 14352 ',' Good app crashes sometimes , ','?'
'id: 14355 ',' Haven  t had any problems ? ','?'
'id: 14364 ',' Love the app, but unfortunately the crashing problem from 2 versions ago is still a problem. ','?'
'id: 14365 ',' Just love it. ','?'
'id: 14381 ',' I have never had an in issue with this App it  s great to have on the go when you need a recipe at the grocery store. ','?'
'id: 14411 ',' It provides inspiration. ','?'
'id: 14421 ',' The only problem that I have noticed is that when you click to view a pin, read it the close it, it starts you back at the beginning of the list and not where you left off at. ','?'
'id: 14422 ',' It always perks me up and makes me happy to see what we as humanity can create, often with very simple ordinary materials. ','?'
'id: 14429 ',' Please do add it back! ','?'
'id: 14435 ',' New ideas for decorating, clothing, parties, recipes, DIY projects; whatever you need, Pinterest has SOMETHING to help you out. ','?'
'id: 14447 ',' It is packed with inspiration &amp; I just love the pinning &amp; sharing!! ','?'
'id: 14451 ',' This app works great, is easy to use, and doesn  t crash often. ','?'
'id: 14464 ',' I love this application I can create my boards for wedding planning, cooking, fashion, and deserts , ','?'
'id: 14466 ',' Now we can  t rename boards in the iPad app but we could before. ','?'
'id: 14470 ',' The app is easy to use, but does tend to crash alot on the iPhone, it  s perfect on a PC or laptop though. ','?'
'id: 14474 ',' The possibilities are endless here!!! ','?'
'id: 14490 ',' I don  t know why I have so much trouble opening the pins? ','?'
'id: 14490 ',' I think it should be easier to open them  and see the full content. ','?'
'id: 14492 ',' What did we do before Pinterest?!? ','?'
'id: 14521 ',' Love the concept of this app, but it crashes pretty frequently. ','?'
'id: 14542 ',' Tried out Pinterest  because my Wife really enjoys it and has gotten several good suggestions for meals\\nI enjoy the pictures and it  s fun to use right up to the point that it shuts down and kicks you off, which seems to happen with surprising regularity\\nOnce you  ve been kick off and return, the time between being kicked off gets shorter and shorter\\nI  m using an iPad to view Pinterest so maybe it  s the reason for the shut downs\\nYour site would be more fun without the shutdowns\\nI DO enjoy Pinterest, thank you , ','?'
'id: 14543 ',' If you need inspiration of any kind you can find it here. ','?'
'id: 14550 ',' I use boards to pin tons of ideas as inspiration when I first start a project or begin planning a party, but it would be nice to have a way to rank the pins to narrow down the ones I want to focus on first! ','?'
'id: 14553 ',' It provides an easy way to share ideas and pictures with friends and followers! ','?'
'id: 14575 ',' The idea and concept of pintrest is great. ','?'
'id: 14582 ',' I have never had any issues. ','?'
'id: 14586 ',' Love how easy it is to find ideas when you need something specific, but also just find things that I never would have thought to try. ','?'
'id: 14602 ',' What did we do before Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 14605 ',' No need to sign in every time and it loads quickly! ','?'
'id: 14614 ',' I just wish people would only post links that were safe , ','?'
'id: 14629 ',' It is very cool how we can touch a picture and then we get the three options on what we can to do, but is there any way that y  all can put another option that saves a pin to the camera roll? ','?'
'id: 14641 ',' There are so many inspiring ideas out there and it has taken my creativity to a whole new level. ','?'
'id: 14641 ',' The app is little tough to learn at first, that  s why only ? ','?'
'id: 14642 ',' \\nYou can create an online scrapbook of your favorite photos. ','?'
'id: 14650 ',' Once I figured out how to navigate this app, it became very easy to switch from looking at my own pins to looking at recent pins of people I follow. ','?'
'id: 14652 ',' We spend time organizing our boards but Pinterest fails to organizing themselves by not putting things in alphabetical order...please learn you ABC  s. , ','?'
'id: 14660 ',' You have to get it!! ','?'
'id: 14672 ',' I have no problems with this app. ','?'
'id: 14675 ',' I really recommend it! ','?'
'id: 14675 ',' You can  t change the board covers anymore change that please! ','?'
'id: 14705 ',' I just love so much Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 14710 ',' ...please consider it!! ','?'
'id: 14722 ',' If you have an iPad, you must get this app. ','?'
'id: 14728 ',' I just love this app, I use it all the time for just about everything. ','?'
'id: 14735 ',' I recommend this app to all! ','?'
'id: 14739 ',' You can create secret boards just for you or invite friends to your secret boards. ','?'
'id: 14750 ',' I like it so far especially when I need recipes or a drink!! ','?'
'id: 14762 ',' If I need it, Pinterest has it! ','?'
'id: 14764 ',' I wish you could drag and drop pins between boards, and delete with pins with one click. ','?'
'id: 14765 ',' I use this all the time..and I just love it! ','?'
'id: 14781 ',' Love it but it crashes a lot :( , ','?'
'id: 14798 ',' Please do not change settings or do a thousand upgrades, we, users do not like! ','?'
'id: 14803 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 14804 ',' I did not get the idea of this app at first but the more I surfed the more I found I needed to return. ','?'
'id: 14813 ',' Seems like the controls are fairly user friendly but every now and then I have to re search for something because it bumps me out to the home page. ','?'
'id: 14830 ',' \\n\\nSecondly, you have to get together with apple so I can just pin from my photos on my phone!! ','?'
'id: 14830 ',' I have to scroll through a list of randomly organized (rather, NOT organized or DISorganized) names to find the one I need. ','?'
'id: 14830 ',' \\n\\nThx, now, can you STOP asking me to rate Pinterest every third or fourth time I try to open it? ','?'
'id: 14832 ',' I need a meeting. ','?'
'id: 14835 ',' Love the abundance of ideas available at your fingertips! ','?'
'id: 14836 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 14839 ',' I adore Pinterest wholeheartedly but I do have a problem with how it does occasionally crash on me. ','?'
'id: 14847 ',' Just wish the scrolling down then back up just a little bit didn  t bring the top menu bar back. ','?'
'id: 14884 ',' And the news ticker (I don  t know what to call the thing that tells me when someone has liked a pin or followed a board) needs a better information hierarchy; an undifferentiated list doesn  t serve me needs ? ','?'
'id: 14898 ',' Just love it. ','?'
'id: 14901 ',' Highly recommend getting it. ','?'
'id: 14905 ',' I have made a few of these great ideas but I  m excited to do so many more! ','?'
'id: 14908 ',' I just wish editing my boards was easier. ','?'
'id: 14911 ',' One thing, I would like to see the subscribers in order of appearance. ','?'
'id: 14913 ',' I love Pinterest, but I think it needs to be revamped. ','?'
'id: 14915 ',' First, you  ll only have a couple boards then you  ll need a couple more because you  ll want to have a\\nPlace for your interests. ','?'
'id: 14926 ',' One issue I do have is sometimes when I pin a Lin and go back to it I can  t necessarily get the pattern or recipe, not sure why. ','?'
'id: 14929 ',' Before Pinterest I had magazine clippings, notebooks, files, etc. all saved with ideas, but I could never find what I needed when I needed it. ','?'
'id: 14931 ',' The app does what it needs to, &amp; I love it. ','?'
'id: 14932 ',' WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE , ','?'
'id: 14933 ',' I absolutely love Pinterest, and have had no problems with the app! ','?'
'id: 14933 ',' You can search and find whatever you could possibly think of, from simple DIY projects to ancient Jewish tombstone inscriptions! ','?'
'id: 14940 ',' My only problem is that some times it just suddenly closes out on me, and I have to wait a bit to open it again. ','?'
'id: 14941 ',' Everyone should use it! ','?'
'id: 14942 ',' Here are some reasons why I enjoy it:\\n\\n1  I have done so many home projects for cheap or have done something I never would have because of creative ideas that are step by step. ','?'
'id: 14942 ',' \\n\\n2 I have been able to look up garden questions or ideas and made a beautiful and productive garden this year. ','?'
'id: 14943 ',' \\n\\nOct 31st\\nHope you are working on this crashing problem. ','?'
'id: 14943 ',' Something needs to be done. ','?'
'id: 14943 ',' Can  t figure out how to clean up my boards. ','?'
'id: 14945 ',' It crashes occasionally, but overall it  s a great app! ','?'
'id: 14947 ',' That means I can  t pin. ','?'
'id: 14975 ',' I love this app it is so much better than just using the web. ','?'
'id: 14982 ',' Just wish you didn  t have to allow others to follow you unless you give permission or maybe allowed to have more secret boards. ','?'
'id: 14983 ',' I wish there was a pin button on my phone where I could pin things I see like I to when I  m on my laptop (maybe there is one for the phone and I just haven  t found it). ','?'
'id: 14986 ',' Once you start looking  you can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 15000 ',' This app has helped me in many more ways than just piecing together a dream wedding. ','?'
'id: 15000 ',' I have figure out how to use photography to my advantage and learned different workouts! ','?'
'id: 15001 ',' I had problems with the app freezing a lot before, but don  t anymore. ','?'
'id: 15006 ',' Great app, but it badly needs two things:\\n1. ','?'
'id: 15006 ',' How do you organize effectively without sub folders? ','?'
'id: 15012 ',' If the link is bad, it should not be able to post. ','?'
'id: 15036 ',' The most recent update was a bit of a change visually, but it only took a couple of minutes to learn how to navigate! ','?'
'id: 15039 ',' I wish it were easier to move my pins from one of my boards to a new board I create. ','?'
'id: 15054 ',' This is still a problem as of 12/27/13!!! ','?'
'id: 15061 ',' No update has been done recently though, and until I read that the problem with Safari is fixed I will try to remember not to upgrade the system. ','?'
'id: 15069 ',' The only thing I suggest would be to update the look more often:) \\nBut as far as the app I love it , ','?'
'id: 15082 ',' There are so many great ideas for crafts and food recipes. ','?'
'id: 15091 ',' Who needs a magazine?! ','?'
'id: 15113 ',' Please provide a solution for an avid user:) , ','?'
'id: 15116 ',' I have no issues with this app and have a bunch of fun with it :) , ','?'
'id: 15129 ',' 5tootle ,  I love Pinterest please change the page back the way it was a few weeks ago , ','?'
'id: 15130 ',' Just wish it would stop crashing, and adding a side bar to scroll through boards would be nice. ','?'
'id: 15133 ',' It  s so easy to save organize and find whatever you need. ','?'
'id: 15150 ',' I  m able to get where I need to go with little problems. ','?'

'id: 15174 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 15186 ',' I have had a Pinterest for a few years, back when you had to request to be part of it and now I use it on both my computer and iPhone. ','?'
'id: 15187 ',' If that option could be added, I  d give it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 15204 ',' I never have any problems. ','?'
'id: 15205 ',' Love Pinterest... I think it would be awesome to have the boards like now plus sub boards. ','?'
'id: 15206 ',' Occasionally when there are new updates it will crash but they generally fix it pretty quickly. ','?'
'id: 15209 ',' I can  t live with out it!! ','?'
'id: 15212 ',' Pinterest must be rated number one app on my phone. ','?'
'id: 15212 ',' Never crashes and never fails. ','?'
'id: 15235 ',' This is the best thing, if you want to know about something it  s somewhere on Pinterest !!!! ','?'
'id: 15247 ',' t know who you have recently hired to change your interface, but I suggest going back to the previous designer. ','?'
'id: 15254 ',' However the site itself is a great idea! ','?'
'id: 15255 ',' s happening , 5,  Heysuzen ,  I can  t explain if you don  t have Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 15255 ',' Truly you are missing a iconoclastic app. ','?'
'id: 15260 ',' The problems with the folders is that if you touch one accidentally (like hit the one above) it pins I to it,before you had to hit the PIN button again which gave you the chance to make sure to hanger the folder with one tap, now you have to go in and delete and move it to the correct folder. ','?'
'id: 15263 ',' The latest update does not work well on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 15267 ',' I just wish you could the app horizontally. ','?'
'id: 15279 ',' Not always clear about how to pin something or follow someone. ','?'
'id: 15280 ',' But it crashes A LOT. ','?'
'id: 15280 ',' Also, I can  t update my board covers, and that should be brought back. ','?'
'id: 15286 ',' The last update did nothing to improve the Pinterest experience  why the change?? ','?'
'id: 15293 ',' Not sure why some people are having issues but mine works just fine. ','?'
'id: 15294 ',' Do wish there was a way to move pins to different boards without having to repin them. ','?'
'id: 15297 ',' But now I enjoy it and you find out more about your friends thru it. ','?'
'id: 15328 ',' The best way to keep on top of today  s style. ','?'
'id: 15335 ',' I love Pinterest, just hate the changes and bugs! ','?'
'id: 15347 ',' App logs out &amp; can  t sign in from time to time. ','?'
'id: 15355 ',' Love the app but it crashes a little much. ','?'
'id: 15356 ',' My Pinterest worked just fine until I just updated it today, now nothing loads!! ','?'
'id: 15356 ',' Please fix or allow me to downgrade! ','?'
'id: 15383 ',' I love Pinterest and the app is easier to use because you just press on a picture the different options to pin it, like and send pop up and all you do is slide to the option. ','?'
'id: 15384 ',' Pinterest is a great idea but can be very disappointing. ','?'
'id: 15387 ',' But LOTS of updating, and it will crash or freeze on you. ','?'
'id: 15388 ',' Not only fun to pass the time when you are bored, or waiting at the dr  s office, but provides so many great ideas and useful tips. ','?'
'id: 15392 ',' The bugs in the app have been fixed over time &amp; I have no complaints except for adding more than 3 secret boards. ','?'
'id: 15393 ',' Having it on the iPad/iPhone just makes it even more addicting. ','?'
'id: 15407 ',' It  s great and I recommend it all the time to others. ','?'
'id: 15410 ',' We just need a list of categories and we don  t need a picture of what the category is. ','?'
'id: 15411 ',' I love it, but every night while I  m on it just crashes for no reason. ','?'
'id: 15423 ',' For the recipes or different DIY things it would be nice to be able to see at rating on how others felt about them or telling if they would try it again or not. ','?'
'id: 15430 ',' I need this fixed now. ','?'
'id: 15443 ',' I get a ton if great ideas and it is the best past time. ','?'
'id: 15460 ',' I believe once people understand its purpose and create a "groove" that serves them best addiction is inevitable!!!! ','?'
'id: 15467 ',' I can  t see who is following specific boards, only generally who is following, unless I am missing something? ','?'
'id: 15475 ',' Do not find much on the Middle East countries though. ','?'
'id: 15484 ',' If you love Pinterest on the computer you need the app. ','?'
'id: 15495 ',' And the only problem that I  ve found is that I spend WAY TOO MUCH time going through it! ','?'
'id: 15501 ',' I just wish you could send multiple pins to one person at a time and the same pin to multiple people at once. ','?'
'id: 15506 ',' Even though this issue had been "fixed" I  m still having problems. ','?'
'id: 15506 ',' Please readdress this issue. ','?'
'id: 15507 ',' Never had a problem with it. ','?'
'id: 15513 ',' It would crash a lot more than it does now. ','?'
'id: 15513 ',' I love Pinterest and all that you can find on there so this is perfect for my smart phone. ','?'
'id: 15515 ',' It does have some issues, such as the shut off in the middle of a pin and not loading at all until I close the app completely which also make me lose the place I have scrolled to. ','?'
'id: 15529 ',' Haven  t seen any glitches just relaxing enjoyment. ','?'
'id: 15537 ',' Four stars because it crashes sometimes, and I do not like the updated search. ','?'
'id: 15539 ',' Just like the Pinterest website. ','?'
'id: 15540 ',' I love the app, but it does seem to crash a lot. ','?'
'id: 15551 ',' When I need a recipe or how to fix my hair, or fashion ideas ,  crafts, Pinterest has it all. ','?'
'id: 15564 ',' The problem I have that drops two stars, the updates don  t fix things; they just add more clutter. ','?'
'id: 15564 ',' It now suggests people who might like a pin sent, every. ','?'
'id: 15564 ',' It would be nice to turn that off. ','?'
'id: 15564 ',' But the app still needs a lot of work. ','?'
'id: 15568 ',' It had everything you need!! ','?'
'id: 15570 ',' e and I create out wedding and wish lists so we know what to get each other for Xmas and bdays. ','?'
'id: 15570 ',' Also helping create our bucket list. ','?'
'id: 15574 ',' Like how it  s gotten easier for me to navigate through. ','?'
'id: 15574 ',' I just don  t like all the notifications for everything, but other than that, it  s awesome! ','?'
'id: 15582 ',' Downloaded a few days ago and haven  t had any issues. ','?'
'id: 15588 ',' ( you even made me a better cook!) ','?'
'id: 15605 ',' I would like to see more categories for browsing it seems all of the DIY Crafts that are lumped together could be better sub divided. ','?'
'id: 15605 ',' Quilts, for instance, should have their own category. ','?'
'id: 15607 ',' It  s like a magazine that you get to design yourself. ','?'
'id: 15611 ',' Instead of just turning the screen orientation the app closes my whole iPad. ','?'
'id: 15615 ',' I would definitely suggest to download it it  s only wonderful thing. ','?'
'id: 15627 ',' I have made several projects and recipes from the ideas that have been shared. ','?'
'id: 15641 ',' I  m planning my wedding and getting ideas from Pinterest but my mom doesn  t know how to use the app so I like sending her pictures from my phone via text. ','?'
'id: 15656 ',' Highly recommend the site and app! ','?'
'id: 15656 ',' The only adjustment I would suggest would be to fix load time as the images sometimes take awhile to upload. ','?'
'id: 15664 ',' I get so many ideas for design and recipes and fun stuff and it also just has a lot of great pictures and it  s fun to look around. ','?'
'id: 15673 ',' If I could turn that option off on this app and the site it would be nice. ','?'
'id: 15698 ',' Please fix it so that it is compatible. ','?'
'id: 15700 ',' The fact that I can use it on the go &amp; just not at home is awesome! ','?'
'id: 15700 ',' Definitely a good app and I  ve never had a problem with it! ','?'
'id: 15724 ',' It crashes once in a while; about two times a week. ','?'
'id: 15727 ',' Please bring that back and keep it! ','?'
'id: 15731 ',' Please bring the old version back! ','?'
'id: 15738 ',' I  ve said more than once that Every woman should have a Pinterest account! ','?'
'id: 15743 ',' I defiantly recommend downloading this app! ','?'
'id: 15747 ',' I had to Google it to discover that you have to tap the camera button, then the little image icon. ','?'
'id: 15754 ',' I was confused of how to use it at first, but now that I  ve figured it out its terribly addicting. ','?'
'id: 15757 ',' The old app was constantly crashing and shutting my ipad completely off. ','?'
'id: 15761 ',' Please bring back the A   Z tabs when looking for categorized pin boards. ','?'
'id: 15770 ',' I could spend hours on it and yet I still don  t know quite how to use it. ','?'
'id: 15776 ',' This app is amazing and always provides me with new ideas for everything!! ','?'
'id: 15781 ',' Previously, the app would crash my iPad and, though it still does this, it  s far and few between crashes. ','?'

'id: 15839 ',' :)  HIGHLY recommend it! ','?'
'id: 15873 ',' While Pinterest is still a great idea, the fact that the home feed is now more than 50% "related pins" is very annoying. ','?'
'id: 15875 ',' Enjoy using on my iPhone and iPad but it still likes to crash. ','?'
'id: 15875 ',' When I try to load a video it almost always crashes. ','?'

'id: 15913 ',' Wish there were more secret boards available. ','?'
'id: 15917 ',' I like sharing info and ideas with others, however, the lack of privacy is an issue. ','?'
'id: 15917 ',' So, I  d like more privacy settings that are already available on other social networking sites and Pinterest would be perfect. ','?'

'id: 16849 ',' There are quite a few pins that you click on and it will only pull up a picture or take you to a completely different page, but other than that, when you find those pages that take you right where you need to be, there  s a world of wonders out there!! ','?'

'id: 17174 ',' This is my favorite app in the world but all of a sudden it starting to crash again and it is really annoying, PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!! ','?'

'id: 17217 ',' So far so good, haven  t had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 17220 ',' Sure would be nice if the app didn  t crash so often while I  m pinning or just freezes. ','?'
'id: 17224 ',' More updates need to be included with this app in order to keep it moving. ','?'
'id: 17225 ',' Which one gets you to the list of categories: the home, magnifying glass, plus sign, or person? ','?'
'id: 17240 ',' If you   like   a pin, you should not be listed as following them. ','?'

'id: 17273 ',' Not a fan of the new layout, and the app still crashes, even on the most recent iOS platform. ','?'
'id: 17280 ',' Whenever I need an idea for anything, I can find a ton here! ','?'
'id: 17291 ',' I receive a lot of pins and its frustrating that the pins show up small I think it would be cool if it comes up like the pins do when we are pinning. ','?'
'id: 17298 ',' Having the pins on the left needs to be moved back to the middle. ','?'
'id: 17301 ',' I do wish, with all the new updates, they made a slide show option because sometimes I just want to flip through my pins(instead of having to click on each one, one at a time). ','?'

'id: 17429 ',' You don  t have to search and search the stuff that interests on the web, its all here, you can also add information you others to see. ','?'
'id: 17431 ',' I also liked that choosing the board did not close my new pin, not allowing me to make any additional changes to the wording if the pin. ','?'
'id: 17436 ',' \\nOne more thing, a lot of other people and I really liked the alphabet scroll bar for the boards, so it would be nice if you could bring that back with your next bug fix. ','?'

'id: 17495 ',' I use Pinterest a lot, and version 3.3 still has the same issue as the last couple of updates. ','?'
'id: 17495 ',' Crashes constantly and will occasionally crash my iPad 3. ','?'
'id: 17495 ',' It needs to be fixed not have useless things added on like a map option. ','?'
'id: 17496 ',' What was the point of this last update, to make the app as difficult as possible to use? ','?'
'id: 17497 ',' I don  t like that you can  t choose board cover with new update. ','?'
'id: 17498 ',' It provides an access to ideas for just about any and everything!!! ','?'

'id: 17536 ',' Please pay attention the the negative feedback. ','?'
'id: 17537 ',' So what happened to the option of saving photos from Pinterest directly to the camera roll on iPads? ','?'
'id: 17538 ',' Totally counterintuitive and just makes things really difficult. ','?'
'id: 17540 ',' It is not user friendly to navigate, and there is an issue where I can  t pin something because the pin button is out of reach. ','?'
'id: 17545 ',' Now I can  t email pins and upgrade is sluggish. ','?'
'id: 17552 ',' Please put it back! ','?'

'id: 17565 ',' Please bring back the last version or let us down grade from this atrocious unusable fail. ','?'
'id: 17567 ',' They just need to update the layout I fill like everything is hidden I want a better task bar. ','?'

'id: 18661 ',' So like how they ask which board you want it in, just have the option to add another board. ','?'
'id: 18667 ',' It is convenient too because if you have pinned a recipe you can look it up in the store to see what ingredients you need. ','?'

'id: 35625 ',' I  m obsessed with the idea, but could use some improvements. ','?'
'id: 35627 ',' So it needs to be fixed :) , ','?'
'id: 35634 ',' All the things I like I one place so I can find them when I need them! ','?'
'id: 35636 ',' I really don  t need to say anything else. ','?'
'id: 35639 ',' There are a few concerns like when you access the app it just force closes or when you click on like "diy" it will try to pull up the pins it will say "no pins available at this time" not convienent and kind of annoying cause you can force close the app and it still appears. ','?'
'id: 35653 ',' I love Pinterest online but being able to take it on the go is a lot more efficient and I can  t stop pinning!!! ','?'
'id: 35656 ',' I just got this stupid app and was actually excited to start browsing. ','?'
'id: 35658 ',' The most recent update made a change that allows an easy repin option by holding your finger (iPad version) on the picture and it automatically pins it to your page. ','?'
'id: 35659 ',' I can  t watch television or go anywhere without seeing something I want to " pin!" ','?'
'id: 35661 ',' I have had no issues with this app...and use it quite often. ','?'
'id: 35667 ',' I keep getting an error message with my email telling me I need to update it. ','?'
'id: 35673 ',' There is always a problem or a message saying there  s a problem , ','?'
'id: 35675 ',' I sit on my phone for hours adding stuff to my boards. ','?'
'id: 35683 ',' This is Amazing, everyone should use this! ','?'
'id: 35687 ',' Hardly ever has an issues! ','?'
'id: 35698 ',' I hate that when you hover or idle your finger over a pin it assumes you want to do something with that pin. ','?'
'id: 35717 ',' It  s crashing again!! ','?'
'id: 35751 ',' Since the latest update I can  t look at my home page. ','?'
'id: 35751 ',' It  s says there are "No Pins currently available" \\nPlease fix this it  s extremely annoying. ','?'

'id: 35787 ',' Would definitely recommend getting the app. ','?'
'id: 35789 ',' Best site ever....has everything....can  t stop going to it, but it crashes to much, please fix it. ','?'
'id: 35790 ',' I just wish there was a way to tell my followers that I completed one of my pins! ','?'
'id: 35797 ',' But if I try to open the pin Pinterest closes. ','?'
'id: 35811 ',' I LOVE Pinterest, but the newest update has been crashing quite a bit while pinning from the web. ','?'
'id: 35811 ',' This app is 100% still useable, but very frustrating when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 35815 ',' I wish there was a way to slide between pins, though, so going back to the board wasn  t necessary to view the next or last one. ','?'
'id: 35815 ',' Editing a pin could be a bit easier, and occasionally it crashes when I open it. ','?'
'id: 35816 ',' It  s so easy to use &amp; I love that you can repin without opening the image , ','?'
'id: 35817 ',' Please fix the bugs :( , ','?'
'id: 35821 ',' I am now looking at the DIY pins for projects to start. ','?'
'id: 35824 ',' It updates your overall boards faster and it so much fun. ','?'

'id: 35830 ',' It  s just so AWSOME you pin things an then you can click on the pic an it tells you how to do it!!! ','?'
'id: 35832 ',' The only issue is not being able to print. ','?'
'id: 35841 ',' I love my pins and boards, but the same day Pinterest added advertising at the top of the home page, IE 10 stopped being able to handle the site. ','?'
'id: 35847 ',' Please fix this problem soon! ','?'
'id: 35849 ',' It  s amazing, but there  s been many occasions where the app stops working and I can  t download pins. ','?'
'id: 35853 ',' Hate when it crashes, but thankfully that is a rarity! ','?'
'id: 35856 ',' One more thing, they should add a little app things right next to the send and repin button and put add to camera roll. ','?'
'id: 35863 ',' The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it will close out unexpectedly and I have to start my search over. ','?'
'id: 35869 ',' I have a first gen iPad and it crashes often. ','?'
'id: 35870 ',' It happens every time please fix it , ','?'
'id: 35871 ',' I would like to see an update in the app to correlate with iOS7. ','?'
'id: 35872 ',' Love the app but I wish you could create folders of your boards. ','?'
'id: 35874 ',' My only complaint and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars, is the constant crashing of the site when I am on my iPad . ','?'
'id: 35879 ',' I will update it when I have time. ','?'
'id: 35889 ',' I can  t log into the app version of Pintrest, I can only log in through safari. ','?'
'id: 35891 ',' Ever since I downloaded the new version to my iPad it crashes every time getting frustrated. ','?'

'id: 35907 ',' Please change the layout of the "popular" pins, they  re to small and very hard to see. ','?'
'id: 35915 ',' The app is convenient when I don  t have access to my laptop, but is missing some of the features of the website. ','?'
'id: 35915 ',' I am often unable to open the source of a linked pin and sometimes the Pin It feature does not work at all. ','?'
'id: 35916 ',' But please fix the issues!!!! ','?'
'id: 35916 ',' I can  t pin or access pins I already have most of the time. ','?'
'id: 35917 ',' This app worked fine until it updated and now it crashes EVERY time I am on it. ','?'

'id: 35951 ',' All my boards are gone so I can  t pin anything to the boards I want to without creating a new one. ','?'
'id: 35958 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 35963 ',' It  s easy to pin or like/unlike something by just keeping your finger pressed down. ','?'
'id: 35966 ',' Don  t get me wrong I love the app and all it  s featured but when I try to create a new account because my old email address crashed. ','?'
'id: 35966 ',' Whenever I put it my new email address it says "checking with availability" and then crashes. ','?'
'id: 35966 ',' Can you please fix it , ','?'
'id: 35971 ',' I just love this app. ','?'
'id: 35971 ',' The only problem is that I  ll need to live to be 200 to get them all done! ','?'
'id: 35978 ',' I like the new features and I  ve had less problems with the site. ','?'
'id: 35980 ',' This thing crashes constantly!!! ','?'
'id: 35983 ',' Perfect when you need to "kill" time, pull out the phone and "pin" away!! ','?'
'id: 35983 ',' Ok sometimes it  s just when I need a fix! ','?'
'id: 35984 ',' The only bad thing I can say about Pinterest is that there are just too many good ideas and not enough time or money in the day!!! ','?'
'id: 35986 ',' \\n\\n I  have seen several boards with a number of pins that "look like me" and now follow the person who created the board. ','?'
'id: 35989 ',' It wont let me post a picture. ','?'
'id: 35989 ',' Especially aggravating that i have to type a decription every time to upload it just for it to fail. ','?'
'id: 35991 ',' I really hate all the new bugs I can  t pin photos from my iPhone to my Pinterest app what gives? ','?'
'id: 35995 ',' This app provides endless inspiration for everything from redecorating your home, to diy (do it  yourself) projects, to artwork inspiration. ','?'
'id: 35995 ',' I rarely need to look anywhere else! ','?'
'id: 35999 ',' I just need more time! ','?'
'id: 36002 ',' Lately all I get is "no pins available" and shuts me down when I actually do get to look at a pin. ','?'
'id: 36004 ',' Just like the website. ','?'
'id: 36004 ',' Only change is the occasional crashes when exploring. ','?'
'id: 36006 ',' Who needs creativity when you can borrow someone else  s! ','?'
'id: 36007 ',' Loved the new update until I updated my phone to iOS7, now it won  t even open. ','?'
'id: 36007 ',' Not blaming it all on Pinterest &amp; have refrained from updating my iPad until Apple works out some of the other bugs but Pinterest needs to address. ','?'
'id: 36017 ',' Just what I needed to get some inspiration for scrap booking and costume making. ','?'
'id: 36023 ',' It crashes once in awhile, which is very annoying. ','?'
'id: 36035 ',' I just wish there was a way for it to show us where all of our double or triple pins are so that we can delete them without going through all of our boards. ','?'
'id: 36035 ',' It would be nice to show it the way iTunes can show you the repeats. ','?'
'id: 36036 ',' A great way to organize and stay current. ','?'
'id: 36037 ',' My only complaint is that I have not been able to add the pin it button on any device, which limits pinning to those items which already have pinning capabilities. ','?'
'id: 36043 ',' Someone really needs to work on that. ','?'
'id: 36049 ',' But it NEEDS to be fixed. ','?'
'id: 36056 ',' I hope you  re working on a fix! ','?'
'id: 36065 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 36067 ',' Only way to be improved would be to stop the random shut down of the app on the ipad. ','?'

'id: 36123 ',' It also would be nice to be able to move a pin from one board to another. ','?'
'id: 36130 ',' Since last update can  t pin from Camera Roll and pins are not showing up. ','?'
'id: 36130 ',' And I don  t like how you have to open up the pin to be able to pin it. ','?'
'id: 36133 ',' Would of given higher stars if that was available. ','?'
'id: 36139 ',' Please fix this issue on iOS 7 , ','?'
'id: 36143 ',' I love love love this app but since the last update its been crashing constantly please fix!!! ','?'
'id: 36151 ',' I just wish my stupid iPad didn  t crash every two seconds when using the app version. ','?'

'id: 36187 ',' Totally addicted, first started Pinterest looking for ideas for my daughter  s wedding, thought it was just a phase until we started renovating our house and started looking for our dream house. ','?'
'id: 36205 ',' However, you have to log into your account when you want to pin something. ','?'

'id: 36231 ',' \\nBut it currently crashes every time someone has emailed me a pin and I try to open it. ','?'

'id: 36334 ',' \\nPinterest, please fix this. ','?'
'id: 36340 ',' What do we do? ','?'
'id: 36342 ',' The only thing that bothers me is people put pictures of things on here, and never tell you how to make or where to buy. ','?'
'id: 36347 ',' U cud add those options, as well as adding a "pin it" button for wen im browsing the web on my iphone &amp; wntin to pin/share something! ','?'
'id: 36351 ',' i.e., I do not want to know how to knit, nor do I want to see what someone else knitted, knitting does NOT interest ME, etc. ','?'

'id: 36371 ',' I love this app I can almost always do what is is that I want with it the only thing I don  t like is I can  t post some sites because of  no photos found and I  m often unable to upload a pic of my choice when this happens : / , ','?'

'id: 36477 ',' Whilst I love this site, the app does not do it justice, it frequently stops and loses the place I was trying to pin causing me to have to start from the beginning, I hope it upgrades soon to improve ease of use , ','?'

'id: 36530 ',' I only wish for it to improve and I haven  t had any problems with it so far besides the fact that it distracts me during homework ;) but I would like to be able to view my duplicate pins; I  m not sure if anyone else feels this way, and I realize it tell me "Pssstt, you  ve already pinned this" but sometimes I need to see the duplicates from before that update came out.

'id: 37740 ',' So many ideas, from inspiration to how to, that would have been nearly impossible to find before Pinterest brought it/us all together. ','?'

'id: 37829 ',' But I just don  t get the same satisfaction at all when I use the app on my phone. ','?'
'id: 37831 ',' Because my brain short circuits and I forget how to make school lunches or how I should organize ski equipment in the garage, I turn to Pinterest every time I need a good idea. ','?'

'id: 37874 ',' There are still a lot of problems with the system that need to be addressed. ','?'

'id: 37964 ',' There are so many creative ideas and wonderful recipes. ','?'
'id: 37974 ',' Appreciate the fact that Pinterest will let me know if I have already pinned something. ','?'
'id: 38002 ',' Best app available. ','?'
'id: 38002 ',' Example: my friends are trying to plan a bridal shower for me and are of course pinning away, but they can  t pin them so the other girls can view or I might be able to see it. ','?'
'id: 38002 ',' \\n\\nThis would be good too if you  re planning a trip with friends and want to share an open board or secret etc. etc. , ','?'
'id: 38004 ',' Would be nice to have a search boards by letter feature. ','?'
'id: 38011 ',' Just wish there was a way to organize boards, for example I have boards for my bathroom, living room, kitchen, etc. ','?'
'id: 38011 ',' It would be nice to put those all in a folder together. ','?'
'id: 38013 ',' It seriously has EVERYTHING you can think of AND shows you how to do it. ','?'
'id: 38018 ',' It makes me happy to just scroll through these different categories when I need inspiration. ','?'
'id: 38022 ',' And now it  s simple, I just pin it! ','?'
'id: 38025 ',' I also agree if would be great if there was a way to drag and drop to pin but I really dont mind the current system. ','?'
'id: 38027 ',' Also please make it where when you type in a letter looking for a board to pin to it will bring up boards that begin with that letter. ','?'

'id: 38046 ',' The recent additions and changes have made Pinterest even easier to use and more useful, if that  s even possible! ','?'
'id: 38049 ',' Would have given it five stars if it was a little faster and didn  t crash. ','?'
'id: 38052 ',' I love Pinterest, but the app has so many problems! ','?'
'id: 38052 ',' And I have to tap on a pin 3 4 times before the link will open. ','?'
'id: 38053 ',' You have to try it! ','?'
'id: 38058 ',' Never have a problem with this app. ','?'
'id: 38058 ',' I even planned a babyshower thanks to Pinterest ! ','?'

'id: 38076 ',' Love Pinterest and this app supports my addiction! ','?'
'id: 38085 ',' The BUT part is having to look at how to do something and you have to either hit 3 more things or its not there at all. ','?'
'id: 38090 ',' love  it but i rather tap the picture of what ever i want and like the PC you can show choices like get it on the web  instead of taking me on a roller coaster to get let say a recipe for example, so please fix it . ','?'
'id: 38105 ',' I honestly haven  t had problems with the app. ','?'
'id: 38106 ',' I wish there was a better way to organize my boards. ','?'
'id: 38106 ',' I would like to have categories of boards like food and then boards in that category like crock pot, dessert, main dishes, etc. ','?'
'id: 38108 ',' I use Pinterest everyday, and compared to most apps, it  s just perfect. . . Glitches are normal, I  m sure you  ll take care of them all, right? ','?'
'id: 38111 ',' Don  t want to link it to my fb &amp; every time I try to upload a picture it fails. ','?'
'id: 38127 ',' I don  t know if the issue is due to my iPod or the app. ','?'
'id: 38138 ',' I think I can  t function without this app . ','?'
'id: 38146 ',' I also love that you can do private boards now too. ','?'
'id: 38164 ',' \\n\\nThe only 3 suggestions I would add are:\\n1) The pins that require purchase should be forced to tag and add the price which would in essence cut down on disappointment and wasting of time. ','?'
'id: 38164 ',' \\n2) More Pinners need to take an active interest in reporting spam. ','?'
'id: 38181 ',' I need to houseclean the boards n think I must not be alone in this. ','?'
'id: 38206 ',' Every girl needs this app!!! ','?'
'id: 38210 ',' I just love it! ','?'
'id: 38215 ',' But I will focus on some wishes:\\nWish I could connect or comment with some of my followers \\nWant to be able to alphabetize my boards to get to them easier\\nDon  t know how to change main picture on board without deleting it \\nWould like to combine some boards \\nWould like to reorganize some boards\\nDon  t know how to pin something  s I find on my I pad if there  s no Pinterest button on that page\\nHow do I put my pictures on Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 38225 ',' This leads me to believe there is a issue with people  s phones not Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 38236 ',' But please fix the crashes I always have to reopen it in order to use it. ','?'
'id: 38239 ',' s IPod ,  Just live this app! ','?'
'id: 38240 ',' If only there was a way to prevent all those pins on subjects I am not interested in staring me in the face when I open Pinterest! ','?'

'id: 38255 ',' Never had any issue! ','?'
'id: 38274 ',' Lester:) ,  I really would love it if I could have more than 3 secret boards , ','?'
'id: 38281 ',' The app freezes frequently and always crashes. ','?'
'id: 38304 ',' No crashes. ','?'
'id: 38308 ',' Only reason I gave it four stars is because it crashes occasionally or my pins do not successfully make it to my pin board. ','?'
'id: 38309 ',' Now I just need an app to actually do all the DIY stuff I pin! ','?'
'id: 38320 ',' I have found some amazing recipes, how to  s, handy ideas, giggles, as well as losing hours of time . ','?'
'id: 38328 ',' It motivates me to fix healthy new things to eat. ','?'

'id: 38480 ',' The ideas I get off of here are AWESOME!!! ','?'
'id: 38501 ',' As a teacher I have found several great ideas that have made my classroom a much richer environment. ','?'

'id: 38539 ',' I haven  t had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 38546 ',' If you have to wait in line or a meeting has lost your attention. ','?'
'id: 38551 ',' (In a good way) Before the app I had to wait until I could use the laptop to pin, and once I did the Internet was slow so I hardly pinned anything! ','?'
'id: 38551 ',' The only problem, which I  m willing to overlook, are the occasional crashes. ','?'
'id: 38553 ',' But I really do not like that you can  t always open the recipes or instructions. ','?'
'id: 38553 ',' \\nA lot of the past problems have been fixed. ','?'
'id: 38553 ',' It stopped doing it and I think it should have that feature back. ','?'
'id: 38556 ',' Just wish it didn  t crash so much. ','?'
'id: 38558 ',' New way to pin is great. ','?'

'id: 38598 ',' I can  t thank u enough! ','?'
'id: 38599 ',' It  s crashed on me a couple of times while using my iPad, but I  m pretty sure I need to update my electronics. ','?'
'id: 38599 ',' It would be really nice if we could rearrange the pins on the boards, or move them from one board to another. ','?'
'id: 38603 ',' However, it would be nice if the links reported as spam were required to be removed in the first place. ','?'
'id: 38604 ',' Not liking the crashes, but love the app! ','?'

'id: 38711 ',' First, I have never ever had the app crashing problem with any of my devices   iPhone, iPad, and iPad mini ','?'
'id: 38711 ',' However, a consideration might be given to limitingi the often dysfunctional ad packed blogs and commercial sales Pin sites have become really annoying, and too often include uninspired and overpriced products. ','?'
'id: 38711 ',' Like others, I too would love to see a "Did It" icon, and a thumbs up/down rating for those projects. ','?'

'id: 38801 ',' There are two issues I have with it. ','?'

'id: 38839 ',' I really like how you can now post photos your find with extreme ease. ','?'
'id: 38840 ',' It has some great features but I wish you could upload from a new pin from a website. ','?'
'id: 38844 ',' The mobile version is SMALL print, which may be a problem for some on an iPhone, but it is addictive and often useful as well. ','?'
'id: 38846 ',' This app is my favorite app to use but I wish there would be no more limits to how many pins or boards I could have. ','?'
'id: 38848 ',' What did I ever do before Pinterest? ','?'

'id: 38856 ',' It  s great except it crashes randomly. ','?'
'id: 38859 ',' Not too much of a hindrance, but it would be nice if I could do that. ','?'
'id: 38866 ',' Maybe I  m just still figuring it out but it doesn  t have the same feel as on my computer , ','?'
'id: 38868 ',' \\n\\nIt would also be nice if you block someone that they cannot locate you and still see what is on any of your boards. ','?'
'id: 38875 ',' I suggest the boards you make could create sub  boards. ','?'
'id: 38882 ',' Good app to keep what you like when you need it. ','?'

'id: 38937 ',' Trd47 ,  I was in a cooking rut, making the same dishes seemingly every week...and then I found Pintrest and I  ve only made the same dish once in the last few months! ','?'
'id: 38937 ',' I am not usually a risk taker but with Pintrest my creative juices can  t stop flowing! ','?'

'id: 38945 ',' I am so glad they created it for iPad, except I am totally addicted to it, and spend way too much time on it! ','?'
'id: 38953 ',' Please fix ASAP! ','?'
'id: 38954 ',' The app is great, sometimes it crashes on me for no reason tho. ','?'
'id: 38955 ',' ,  I love Pinterest, I am always learning so much from making all natural house cleaners to making a water blob for my kids to finding how to organize almost anything! ','?'

'id: 39015 ',' I highly recommend it if your a DIY type of person or a Creative. ','?'
'id: 39021 ',' I went to update Pinterest and instead of updating it completely removed the app. ','?'
'id: 39033 ',' You have to start from the top of the page all over again, or if you follow a link to someone else  s page and you have a phone call it can be very difficult to find your way back. ','?'
'id: 39035 ',' If I wonder how to do something I know where to go. ','?'
'id: 39045 ',' Wish it was easier to search your own pins, but I have the same issue with the web version. ','?'
'id: 39045 ',' Would also like to see the ability to mass move pins (if you create a new board and want to move pins from other boards). ','?'
'id: 39054 ',' Currently I give this a five star rating,\\nBut my question is how are they going to pay for this in the future? ','?'
'id: 39054 ',' \\nWe all know that many apps when you update them, turn into useless piles of crap! ','?'
'id: 39065 ',' When I need to procrastinate. ','?'
'id: 39071 ',' I use it daily &amp; I really like the new way to pin if you don  t need a full view of the pic. ','?'
'id: 39073 ',' Pinterest crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 39073 ',' After 2 or 3 tries, the screen reverts back to the picture and you have to start over, or just plain scroll. ','?'
'id: 39073 ',' I find scrolling tedious, but less frustrating than not being able to predict when/ if the alphabet slider will work. ','?'
'id: 39073 ',' Another good shortcut, which would also be helpful on a computer, would be the option of just typing in the first letter of your board you want to pin to, and have your cursor jump to that letter group. ','?'
'id: 39073 ',' Also, it would be nice if the press and hold feature would let you get to the original website after you have enlarged the pin. ','?'
'id: 39078 ',' Personally haven  t had any technical issues with either. ','?'
'id: 39079 ',' What did I ever do without it? ','?'

'id: 39111 ',' I like having this app, because it allows me to keep up with what my friends and family are interested in. ','?'
'id: 39116 ',' I like the new updates and it rarely crashes. ','?'
'id: 39119 ',' Sometimes you pin something on the wrong board then you have to go find it and edit then it will move, I you could click and drag it would be so much easier. ','?'
'id: 39123 ',' I get so many fabulous ideas and I just make the most wonderful recipes. ','?'
'id: 39124 ',' Other than a couple of glitches with the app crashing, it  s great! ','?'
'id: 39126 ',' Even though it might have a glitch here and there, I love this app!! ','?'
'id: 39134 ',' Hasn  t crashed since I downloaded it so over all a good app. ','?'
'id: 39145 ',' Please fix the crashes :( , ','?'
'id: 39153 ',' This app would be so much better if there was a way to rearrange and organize things you pinned. ','?'
'id: 39153 ',' I would rate the app 5stars, but since I can  t rearrange pins it only gets 4. ','?'
'id: 39160 ',' Just wish you could have more than three secret boards. ','?'

'id: 39230 ',' Love this app, the ability to organize needs much improvement. ','?'
'id: 39230 ',' The suggestion of dragging and dropping by an earlier reviewer is a great idea! ','?'

'id: 39725 ',' Sometimes it will not allow you to click on the picture to find the website. ','?'
'id: 39736 ',' Why would you remove the "repin" button? ','?'

'id: 39838 ',' I plan my family meals with Pintrest! ','?'
'id: 39860 ',' If the app needs updated or fixed it is addressed timely. ','?'
'id: 39864 ',' What I like best is that you can pin a photo by posting the link. ','?'
'id: 39868 ',' I have purchased off a site linked to a pin and got scammed, so you need to be careful! ','?'

'id: 39877 ',' Before the update this was not an issue. ','?'
'id: 39886 ',' Lol I find it really funny how the only time I get asked to rate this app for my iPad is after it crashes in the middle of me trying to read something. ','?'
'id: 39886 ',' I log back on and it  s like "oh hey there, I know we just screwed you, but wanna rate us anyway?" ','?'
'id: 39886 ',' Im not like a pinaholic or anything I go on maybe few hours total per week, but considering it crashes every time I  m on here, at least twice is pretty annoying. ','?'
'id: 39886 ',' That actually how I measure when to get off, I always say, "ok I  ll just look under this category until it crashes, then I  ll go to bed." ','?'
'id: 39887 ',' So just giving you a heads up! ','?'
'id: 39890 ',' My only wish would be an update that would allow you to link related boards or to create sub boards in a board with a broad range such as "food". ','?'
'id: 39891 ',' This is my new go to place when I need ideas. ','?'
'id: 39897 ',' I just wish there were a way to auto scroll to the bottom like there is one for the top, or, a way to search for specific pins on your boards. ','?'

'id: 39902 ',' Don  t like the frequent changes and crashes but I love the site. ','?'

'id: 41252 ',' I have came up with some ideas and this app can get even bigger and profitable but I am just an inventor waiting for a break what have you got to lose? ','?'
'id: 41258 ',' I love how you can send pins and search your own pins! ','?'

'id: 42089 ',' That way if I have an idea in my head I can use my phone rather than printing pics. ','?'
'id: 42093 ',' I pin a lot of recipes and when I go to the store without a list, I just look up the ingredients while I  m there. ','?'
'id: 42102 ',' I wish that when you send a pin to a friend, you could comment on it &amp; the person who sent it could see what you wrote. ','?'
'id: 42103 ',' So many great ideas, in so many areas of life that are useful! ','?'
'id: 42111 ',' This app is great to get ideas on how to do makeup, hair, outfits, and so on. ','?'
'id: 42120 ',' I used to have problems with crashing whenever I backed out from a website and went back to my boards but they fixed it. ','?'
'id: 42122 ',' Highly recommend it!!! ','?'
'id: 42123 ',' There are so many great ideas out there to share and this app makes them easy to find, pin and share on Facebook. ','?'
'id: 42123 ',' The only thing that is a negative for me is that so far, it doesn  t look like there is a way to alphabetize your boards. ','?'
'id: 42143 ',' It helps me think outside of the box and best of all it shows me how to do things the cheapest way possible. ','?'
'id: 42144 ',' The only problem is the difficulty on the app vs the computer is uploading a new website.otherwise a good app , ','?'
'id: 42148 ',' This is a great great idea. ','?'
'id: 42152 ',' It  s never crashed on me like most apps either. ','?'
'id: 42154 ',' Please bring these back!!!! ','?'
'id: 42157 ',' I thought it was all hoopla, but it actually has added some organization to my life, assisted in group planning and improved productivity. ','?'
'id: 42159 ',' JazyJaz112 ,  I can  t believe I just discovered this! ','?'
'id: 42166 ',' It just opens up so many ideas and possibilities for me. ','?'
'id: 42168 ',' I like that you can create your own personalized boards for easy organization. ','?'
'id: 42185 ',' Wish I knew how to shut them off. ','?'
'id: 42202 ',' Too many errors can  t leave comments. ','?'
'id: 42208 ',' I like the new way to "hold down" to pin on both my phone and tablet and that you kept the original way to pin, too. ','?'
'id: 42208 ',' \\n\\nI agree with a few of the other reviewers that there should be easier ways to transfer pins from board to board on the personal page and there needs to be a "back to the top" or "new pins" button that pops up so scrolling doesn  t make my head spin. ','?'
'id: 42214 ',' I love Pinterest but the app needs improvements. ','?'
'id: 42225 ',' I have not used this much, but looks like this app could be used as a cyber space, to store stuff you are interested in, reducing the use of paper. ','?'
'id: 42242 ',' I haven  t had any problems with the app , ','?'
'id: 42252 ',' Great app, but crashes sometimes. ','?'

'id: 42332 ',' I have no issues with the app itself. ','?'
'id: 42344 ',' This app is ridiculous and I suggest just using Safari for your Pinterest needs , ','?'
'id: 42345 ',' I have no problems, thus far, but I just downloaded it about a week ago. ','?'
'id: 42359 ',' It occasionally crashes, but not often enough for it to be a problem. ','?'

'id: 42387 ',' Lots of fun, but sometimes crashes on my iPhone. ','?'
'id: 42390 ',' I find myself often copying and pasting a URL from Chrome into Pinterest and then pinning it that way, which is a pain. ','?'
'id: 42390 ',' It would be great if it were easier to do a web search while in Pinterest (not just a pin search), OR  and here  s my brilliant idea  if there were a pin it button I could have in my browser that would open the link in the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 42399 ',' Like chips you just can  t stop looking at one thing! ','?'
'id: 42403 ',' It could use more secret boards though , ','?'
'id: 42408 ',' Best thing since sliced bread especially since it not only shows you recipes you can use that sliced bread in but also, cute toasters, knives, kitchens...oh the pins go on and on. ','?'
'id: 42411 ',' Only problem I have is with answering a phone call or text &amp; funding myself at the top of the feed when I go back into Pinterest  oh, and the fact that now someone needs to start a Pinners Anonymous because its that addictive!!! ','?'

'id: 42430 ',' As of 8/29/13  recently had issues with most pins in one of my boards but it looks as though it has been fixed. ','?'
'id: 42438 ',' You make it easier to pin, like or send but how can that happen if you can  t see the picture? ','?'
'id: 42446 ',' My one complaint is not being able to view people  s about me section &amp; websites on the mobile app. ','?'

'id: 42506 ',' I just wish there was a way to communicate more with your followers/friends/family and to edit your comments after posting the comment on the pin in case of a mistake instead of having to delete the entire thing &amp; retype it. ','?'

'id: 43038 ',' Definitely recommend it! ','?'
'id: 43050 ',' I am only giving it four stars because sometimes it just closes for no reason. ','?'
'id: 43064 ',' It takes incredibly long to load, if it even loads at all, and crashes several times, usually freezing up my phone. ','?'
'id: 43066 ',' There are so many things you can learn  from recipes to how to organize your home. ','?'

'id: 43117 ',' Please fix the crashes. ','?'
'id: 43144 ',' The only problem I have with it is that it sometimes closes randomly. ','?'
'id: 43145 ',' Two things that would make it better, 1  be nice to have the ability to reorganize items within your board more easily by touch, drag, and drop onto a new board or even within the same board and 2  be cool to have alert for items you are searching for so that you can more quickly fill that want. ','?'
'id: 43149 ',' Once you start you can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 43150 ',' Review ,  It doesn  t matter if I  m looking for a funky new wardrobe for my toddler, planning my oldest daughter  s wedding, hungry for a new dessert, itching to build something new, frustrated with a stubborn stain, in desperate need of organizing my chaotic life, need a quick giggle, looking for the newest decorating trend or getting in the mood for a holiday, I can find it on Pinterest!!! ','?'
'id: 43151 ',' One request: I would find it so much easier to actually use pins if I could only have ability to organize them once pinned. ','?'
'id: 43167 ',' But, I wish you could move pins around. ','?'
'id: 43167 ',' Maybe if I tried on the computer? ','?'
'id: 43171 ',' Once you start you can  t stop :) , ','?'
'id: 43180 ',' I couldn  t plan my wedding without it :) , ','?'
'id: 43197 ',' It  s painfully slow and crashes all the time. ','?'

'id: 43243 ',' This is exactly what I need to help me organize my to do lists and my i wish lists. ','?'

'id: 43288 ',' It  s very easy to find what you need. ','?'

'id: 43307 ',' Just about the time things seem to settle down, they update it again. ','?'
'id: 43307 ',' I don  t know what the issue is, but it is so irritating. ','?'

'id: 43364 ',' \\nAnd it would also be nice if it had an option to "jump to where I left off" so I don  t have to scroll all the way through boards from the beginning each time. ','?'
'id: 43387 ',' I like how, with an iPhone you can simply hold and pin, like or email the link. ','?'
'id: 43403 ',' The app itself has seen some great updates but there is room for improvement: The app crashes fairly often and there is no option to open the link directly in Safari except after it has mostly loaded in the app platform. ','?'
'id: 43416 ',' Update needs to improve. ','?'
'id: 43422 ',' As soon as you start telling me I can  t post adult things you  ve begun treating me like a child. ','?'
'id: 43437 ',' Dislike political and negative social comments  which I have to read or see while looking for things of interest to me. ','?'
'id: 43437 ',' Guess I need to learn to navigate around them. ','?'
'id: 43444 ',' Also I often want to put the items I like into a board and it is more difficult than it needs to be. ','?'
'id: 43447 ',' It has its bugs like most apps, but concept wise it is awesome! ','?'
'id: 43449 ',' The only reason I didn  t give it 5 stars is because it freezes and crashes and takes me back to the top of my feed , ','?'
'id: 43453 ',' I really enjoy the convenience to plan and organize items of interest and inspiration. ','?'
'id: 43453 ',' My only dislike is the recent update on how to pin items  the holding down pops up to easily and makes me accidentally pin things that I did not want to. ','?'
'id: 43456 ',' Also, you can  t open a link in Internet Explorer on the iPad, like you can on the iPhone. ','?'

'id: 43459 ',' One thing in not clear on is how to pin a link from the bed while using my mobile device. ','?'
'id: 43470 ',' It really is a good app for when you have to wait somewhere or if you just need a minute. ','?'
'id: 43478 ',' We use it at work, too for finding inspiration for projects so I do wish you could have more than 3 secret boards. ','?'
'id: 43479 ',' they update often and I never have a problem with it! ','?'
'id: 43489 ',' It crashes the app and I have to restart and re find whatever I was at. ','?'

'id: 43496 ',' Please take care of this problem so I can enjoy the app even more. ','?'

'id: 43565 ',' Just luv it. ','?'
'id: 43569 ',' I  m sure not a prude but Facebook needs a little cleaning up. ','?'

'id: 43576 ',' Haven  t quite learned how to find specific items a second time. ','?'
'id: 43591 ',' Multiple times during the session tho it just crashes for no reason. ','?'
'id: 43591 ',' Further it only shows a limited number of pins from a certain section before you have to start over. ','?'
'id: 43591 ',' STILL CRASHES FOR NO REASON AFTER MULTIPLE REPORTS TO TECH SUPPORT and updates , ','?'
'id: 43594 ',' Having the app on my phone and my ipad has allowed me to have access to my pins anytime I need to refer to one. ','?'
'id: 43600 ',' I love that you can choose your board covers, check out what  s "popular", search different categories, and "follow" other people and/or their specific boards. ','?'
'id: 43613 ',' \\nThe app crashes sometimes, but it is definitely worth getting!! ','?'
'id: 43615 ',' Please fix this problem:) , ','?'
'id: 43617 ',' I am constantly using it at the store to look up things I need for a project or ingredients I need for a dish. ','?'
'id: 43618 ',' You can spend hours looking for delicious recipes, reading quotes, learning how to do crafts, how to decorate   so many interesting things to see. ','?'

'id: 43629 ',' Very often there are no pins available. ','?'
'id: 43633 ',' what did I do wrong? ','?'
'id: 43633 ',' How can I get my old stuff back!? ','?'

'id: 45169 ',' Haven  t used it for a long period of time just between killing time so that might be why I haven  t experienced the other problem people are reporting but none the less love it! ','?'
'id: 45173 ',' I find it crashes every time I use it at least twice. ','?'
'id: 45176 ',' s heiress ,  Love Pinterest and most of the updates but, it would be nice to have the "recently pinned" part like there is for iPhone on iPad. ','?'
'id: 45176 ',' Also please add search by letter to iPad. ','?'
'id: 45179 ',' I would also like to see my recent activity. ','?'
'id: 45187 ',' I need Pinterest Anonymous. ','?'
'id: 45191 ',' \\n\\nThis app also needs a feature for full screen slideshow mode within any board or the users pin wall. ','?'
'id: 45194 ',' I just love this ap. ','?'
'id: 45207 ',' The only problem with it is that it is so dang addicting , ','?'
'id: 45209 ',' It does everything I expect a pintrest app to do. ','?'
'id: 45214 ',' Love Pinterest,  BUT I went with 4/5 stars because I wish that the order of the boards could be changed. ','?'
'id: 45214 ',' So, to improve make subcategories for the boards or better yet just make it possible to move the board order around. ','?'
'id: 45221 ',' Love Pinterest, use it constantly, although it crashes on occasion, I still love it bunches. ','?'
'id: 45223 ',' Great concept, but almost every time I use it for more than 7 8 minutes, it crashes on both my iMac &amp; my iPad. ','?'
'id: 45223 ',' Please address this issue! ','?'
'id: 45233 ',' I am n awe of all the exciting things you post. ','?'
'id: 45255 ',' I love this site and the great information the is available. ','?'
'id: 45262 ',' Move over Facebook and twitter Pinterest is here to stay! ','?'
'id: 45273 ',' The constantly changing how to pin/like things or how to access different functions gets a little frustrating but otherwise the app is good. ','?'
'id: 45279 ',' But I think it  s LAME LAME LAME that you have to have a Facebook account to be a Pinterest member. ','?'
'id: 45297 ',' App seems to be getting better but it still crashes on occasion. ','?'
'id: 45299 ',' I can  t stop pinning , ','?'
'id: 45303 ',' Why can  t you import Facebook photo anymore? ','?'
'id: 45325 ',' I have everything at my finger tips when I need and want it. ','?'
'id: 45329 ',' STOP updating and changing it. ','?'
'id: 45347 ',' I live Pinterest but I  m getting frustrated and have been going on less because the app will crash and ill try again and it will just keep crashing! ','?'
'id: 45351 ',' I recommend it to everyone and I just rant and rave about all the ideas everyone posts. ','?'
'id: 45402 ',' Just should work on making the things I pin , ','?'
'id: 45408 ',' I just love it and the features make it easier to use than the original, in my opinion. ','?'
'id: 45417 ',' The last update made the work so much slower than before. ','?'
'id: 45417 ',' Why make something that was easy now more difficult to use? ','?'
'id: 45419 ',' They recently added multiple features that allow the user to   pin   faster and more efficiently. ','?'
'id: 45427 ',' Why the difference in the way the app is on different phones? ','?'
'id: 45427 ',' Please update Pinterest for all phones to be just as cool as the one on the iPhone . ','?'
'id: 45430 ',' I get hardly any crashes or problems since the last update. ','?'
'id: 45431 ',' Maybe we can  t do it or have it quite yet, but the hope and the actual beautiful visual aspect of it we can. ','?'
'id: 45431 ',' Or it can be the inspiration we need to create something similar and finally feel part of who we are begin to show. ','?'
'id: 45431 ',' And it  s not just for women but men even have a place here! ','?'
'id: 45441 ',' Never had an issue , ','?'
'id: 45443 ',' There are some things they need to fix like;" Edit your pages". ','?'
'id: 45443 ',' There is no options to change the pages to secret after you create them. ','?'
'id: 45467 ',' \\nI have never had a problem with the app. ','?'
'id: 45468 ',' And when I  m in a hurry and need a recipe, decoration, or helpful advice I know it  s just a quick click away! ','?'
'id: 45470 ',' I love the new version, all you have to do to pin or like is hold down on the picture and it brings up all your boards! ','?'
'id: 45476 ',' I love the feature that you can send pins now. ','?'
'id: 45478 ',' It would be great if you could add multiple pics to one pin (ex. ','?'
'id: 45483 ',' Like it, could love it if the Ipad version could have the option to open site in Safari like the Ipod. ','?'
'id: 45485 ',' s girl ,  Would be nice to have more than three secret boards. ','?'
'id: 45488 ',' I have to admit, at first I just didn  t get the attraction but now am totally addicted. ','?'
'id: 45488 ',' I also think there should be a limit on the length of a pin. ','?'
'id: 45489 ',' Also, I think it would be helpful if there \\nwere a contact email to which users could email questions and the like for technical help (i.e. trouble with posting pins). ','?'
'id: 45493 ',' Warning: Pinterest is addictive but it  s also so fun and full of great craft ideas and recipes for every occasion, not to mention great humor when you need a pick me up! ','?'
'id: 45498 ',' I need Pinterest rehab!!!!! ','?'
'id: 45502 ',' There are so many great ideas on here , ','?'
'id: 45509 ',' I use it on the iPad all the time and have had no problems whatsoever. ','?'
'id: 45512 ',' They  ve made some great improvements to the app, like the ability to send pins. ','?'
'id: 45524 ',' However, as many have said the crashing problem needs to be fixed fast. ','?'
'id: 45537 ',' I love this app, it is very addicting:) i love all the diy projects and it made me bond with my kids more, thanking this app us not enough, it has tranformed my thoughts cause there are so many possibilities, great app:) , ','?'
'id: 45539 ',' So far, no crashes after the last update. ','?'
'id: 45539 ',' I like the idea of being able to drag &amp; drop to organize pins/boards if you can add that in the future. ','?'
'id: 45543 ',' I haven  t had any problems with the app crashing or slowing my phone. ','?'
'id: 45546 ',' Obsessed; literally can  t stop pinning. ','?'
'id: 45553 ',' Love this app as well as the site, although there  s a few things you have to do on your computer that you can  t do on your iPhone. ','?'
'id: 45564 ',' I need to be able to rearrange my pins, which can not be done at this time. ','?'
'id: 45565 ',' Everything you  d want to know is on this site! ','?'
'id: 45569 ',' If the idea is convenience, Pinterest has achieved the opposite. ','?'
'id: 45569 ',' Repinning is the only thing I need a shortcut for. ','?'
'id: 45581 ',' I never have any problems with it so far when I  m using it either. ','?'
'id: 45582 ',' I need to see something before I can execute it, since I am a very visual person. ','?'
'id: 45585 ',' I need my fix everyday. ','?'
'id: 45586 ',' But frankly I feel like its fine the way it is, and it intermittently crashed and is somewhat unstable but besides that, I think the Pinterest app for iPhone, iPad and iPod is an efficient and all around great app! ','?'
'id: 45591 ',' I am completely addicted to this site and I very rarely have problems searching throughout Pinterest via my app. ','?'
'id: 45595 ',' Just like the website. ','?'
'id: 45597 ',' I have had no bugs except it does shut down after a while but otherwise it is wonderful and easy to use , ','?'
'id: 45598 ',' It  s a fantastic resource and inspiring place to get great ideas, recipes, and how to  s. Only one thing would make it better, that is having a "print recipe" button that would allow us to easily print selected pages/recipes to cook or shop from more easily. ','?'
'id: 45603 ',' I suggest this to anyone and everyone. ','?'
'id: 45610 ',' I love Pinterest but wish there was a way to quickly move pins from one board to another. ','?'
'id: 45615 ',' Have to set a time limit or I will be on the site 24/7! ','?'
'id: 45619 ',' I would like it if they could add a side a z scrolling bar when selecting which board you want to goose from. ','?'
'id: 45626 ',' Why can I only do this in the "following" segment? ','?'
'id: 45631 ',' Website is awesome, but the app needs some work. ','?'
'id: 45633 ',' I can  t stop pinning , ','?'
'id: 45634 ',' I would give this interesting app 4 or 5 stars if there was an easy way to pin original material. ','?'
'id: 45652 ',' After a comment from my daughter in la made a comment about seven new projects she just had to do. ','?'
'id: 45654 ',' I have gotten so many amazing ideas for my dream wedding, and how to even reuse those things and incorporate them into our home afterwards. ','?'
'id: 45654 ',' I HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone from the crafty DIYer to the inspirationalist, to those wanting to get fit and looking great ideas and motivations. ','?'
'id: 45675 ',' I really enjoy this app, it has crashed. ','?'
'id: 45689 ',' Search function &amp; results should be upgraded. ','?'
'id: 45701 ',' Definitely would like to see ability to organize Boards into sub boards. ','?'
'id: 45706 ',' I loooooove this app but ever since I updated it when I search something it won  t load all the pics of each pin!!! ','?'
'id: 45717 ',' I love spending hours looking for cool ideas and saving them for later but every time I try to connect to a pin to see the post the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 45725 ',' I give it 4 stars because it crashes often. ','?'
'id: 45726 ',' I am a Big Fab of Pinterest:) it helps me find great articles to support my lifestyle! ','?'
'id: 45747 ',' My only critique is that a lot of the sites that are linked to the pictures do not work. ','?'
'id: 45762 ',' My boyfriend tells me all the time that I need an intervention because I  m always on this site!!! ','?'
'id: 45767 ',' When I need a inspiration this is the place to go. ','?'
'id: 45767 ',' Right now it just sends the the pin/link to the person. ','?'
'id: 45778 ',' My app crashes all the time still, I love Pinterest and wish it worked better on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 45779 ',' I never plan an event without going to Pinterest first! ','?'
'id: 45779 ',' The greatest ideas are on this site for food, decorations, drinks, gifts and hot men!! ','?'
'id: 45782 ',' Pinterest, you are awesome, but that new way to re pin is the worst. ','?'
'id: 45782 ',' The notification if you have previously added a specific pin in the past. ','?'
'id: 45783 ',' I haven  t had one problem with the Pinterest application since I started using it a year ago! ','?'
'id: 45785 ',' I rarely have any problems with this app. ','?'
'id: 45785 ',' Not sure why, but it  s not a horrible thing  maybe I just rush it. ','?'
'id: 45790 ',' I updated the app and now it crashes every time I open it! ','?'
'id: 45791 ',' Im not gonna use fancy words, all i need to say is that I LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!! ','?'
'id: 45801 ',' I  ve never had any issues with it either! ','?'
'id: 45805 ',' Stephtravbailey ,  I only wish I could get paid to be on here all day. ','?'
'id: 45815 ',' Where was Pinterest when I was younger!? ','?'
'id: 45819 ',' Love this app can  t get enough of it! ','?'
'id: 45822 ',' Only problem I have is it crashes on a sort of regular basis, especially if I  m going to look at bigger pins. ','?'
'id: 45834 ',' Love it has never crashed just gets a little weird while trying to pin but for the most part I have no problems , ','?'
'id: 45852 ',' App occasionally crashes but love Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 45870 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 45872 ',' Never had any problems with the app and find the updates helpful. ','?'
'id: 45872 ',' I would suggest making the profile pictures able to be larger because when trying to find other pinners on a phone or something with a smaller screen you can  t see people  s picture to know if its who you  re looking for. ','?'
'id: 45873 ',' It  s has a few bugs but other than that I love it!!! ','?'
'id: 45880 ',' It is all available and I don  t have to pay to see movies through my Cable or Satellite providers. ','?'
'id: 45880 ',' Please make Pinterest easier for us older folk. ','?'
'id: 45880 ',' How do I be more selective and less common to be able to pin specific ideas not just such broad ones? ','?'
'id: 45893 ',' You are on your own if you need assistance. ','?'
'id: 45897 ',' Give it one because it crashes on my iphone. ','?'
'id: 45902 ',' I definitely recommend getting this app. ','?'
'id: 45920 ',' I use this app whenever I need inspiration. ','?'
'id: 45929 ',' This app crashes all the time! ','?'
'id: 45933 ',' Easiest, Fastest Way to ANY RECIPE, TASK, NEED TO KNOW. ','?'
'id: 45933 ',' OR WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW ABOUT. ','?'
'id: 45934 ',' Except for the fact that it updates its format every 3 seconds, I love Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 45940 ',' Pattonluks ,  You can get lost for hours here until the Internet connection gets slow for a moment and then it crashes. ','?'
'id: 45946 ',' But I  m sure that will be available soon. ','?'
'id: 45947 ',' It  s easy to use, but I keep having the problem of it crashing right after I pin something. ','?'
'id: 45947 ',' I would love it if there was a way to organize them into groups (like friends, businesses, etc) and I also wish there was a way to search within the people you follow to find a specific person. ','?'
'id: 45961 ',' This app hasn  t crashed on me yet and it is so addicting. ','?'
'id: 45967 ',' It is so fun and enticing that once you have played, you may  never be able to go a day without playing again. ','?'
'id: 45971 ',' This app provides terrific ideas for all that you are searching for. ','?'
'id: 45982 ',' Ive never had any problems with app itself. ','?'
'id: 45993 ',' Works well for the most part; it occasionally crashes but too often. ','?'
'id: 45995 ',' Its annoying how you have to slide your finger to repin , ','?'
'id: 45997 ',' I really like this app, the only thing I  d change is how often it crashes. ','?'
'id: 46006 ',' Very smooth, no crashes thus far. ','?'
'id: 46009 ',' I have issues with viewing some of the pins. ','?'
'id: 46009 ',' Overall it does what I need it to do. ','?'
'id: 46012 ',' It would be cool though if there was a way to contact people through a link on their pages. ','?'
'id: 46012 ',' That way it could be creating new friendships as well :). ','?'
'id: 46016 ',' Please stop the modifications so I can get acquainted with this one before you jump to a new one. ','?'
'id: 46031 ',' New update rarely crashes, a huge improvement over last version. ','?'
'id: 46046 ',' Love it, it  s nice to have when you need an idea for dinner, a party or almost anything you can think of!!! ','?'
'id: 46049 ',' However, the app crashes a lot so I give it 4 stars. ','?'
'id: 46065 ',' I just love love love everything about Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 46067 ',' Help me when I was planning my wedding. ','?'
'id: 46073 ',' Awesome app but definitely needs some bugs worked out! ','?'
'id: 46075 ',' The computer and phone work totally fine, but, the iPad version  crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 46075 ',' If I click on a pin, it crashes. ','?'
'id: 46075 ',' Please please pretty please help with the crashing!!! ','?'
'id: 46080 ',' Please fix this issue. ','?'
'id: 46102 ',' The only thing that needs fixing is that when you go to look at it sometimes the website isn  t there to give specifics but other than amazing! ','?'
'id: 46109 ',' I love this app and I  m on it at least once a day but ever since the update it freezes and crashes a lot so I have been avoiding using it for about a week now. ','?'
'id: 46110 ',' User friendly, haven  t had many issues with updating. ','?'
'id: 46130 ',' I LOVE Pinterest until I updated it! ','?'
'id: 46130 ',' It hardly ever did that before I updated it , ','?'
'id: 46131 ',' Lol Besides the pictures, you can find tons of helpful info  from recipes, to how to tips. ','?'
'id: 46140 ',' I recommend it to all my friends , ','?'
'id: 46154 ',' My favorite categories are the recipes and fashion which is great so I don  t have to print out recipes or get a cook book it  s on my phone when I need it all I need to do is "pin" it. ','?'
'id: 46162 ',' Just wish I knew how to delete duplicates and how to rearrange pins. ','?'
'id: 46167 ',' I love this application even though it crashes a lot and has to be reopened every now and then. ','?'
'id: 46180 ',' My go to in how to  s! ','?'
'id: 46180 ',' \\nI recommend this app as often as u can! ','?'
'id: 46186 ',' Even when I block a name it will show up on my board again, several weeks later. ','?'
'id: 46188 ',' Please fix the bug ASAP!! ','?'
'id: 46189 ',' And I like that you can view the sites right in the app without being redirected to safari. ','?'
'id: 46195 ',' She is everyone  s favorite, you want to hate her but you can  t you just Love her so much and you learn from her everyday. ','?'
'id: 46223 ',' I  ve personally never had a problem with the updates. ','?'
'id: 46240 ',' There are such creative people here, their ideas are simple, yet so easy. ','?'
'id: 46245 ',' Highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! ','?'
'id: 46256 ',' I enjoy using it, it  s as easy and fun as twitter yet as useful as Facebook and like Instagram you get to post pictures, but more resourceful and personalized than all 3. ','?'
'id: 46258 ',' Some of the new updates provided just the added capabilities I needed!! ','?'
'id: 46270 ',' I would love to see the board browsing by alphabet letter back, and maybe some more categories , ','?'
'id: 46271 ',' Never had any problems , ','?'
'id: 46276 ',' Definitely recommend it. ','?'
'id: 46278 ',' But all the new updates on how to pin items is getting old. ','?'
'id: 46278 ',' I liked the last 2 ways how to pin with holding down your finger and it would pin it right away or just simply pressing pin. ','?'
'id: 46278 ',' Now you have to hold it down and drag it to what you want to do with the pin. ','?'
'id: 46280 ',' I like that there are 2 columns of pins within my boards, makes it easy to find a pin that I need to get to. ','?'
'id: 46295 ',' The tips and ideas are very motivating for any topic imaginable. ','?'
'id: 46295 ',' There really is something for everyone here. ','?'
'id: 46296 ',' I love browsing Pinterest on my phone but sometimes I wish the zoom capability could be used. ','?'
'id: 46298 ',' Upon installing the latest update my ipad crashed and would not open or reboot until it died. ','?'
'id: 46298 ',' Now every time I open Pinterest it crashes, and freezes was so much better before. ','?'
'id: 46308 ',' I haven  t had any problems with this app yet. ','?'
'id: 46314 ',' Haven  t had any crash issues. ','?'
'id: 46329 ',' Love the Pinterest app, but wish there was a way to quickly edit the comments on what I re pin. ','?'
'id: 46334 ',' I would also like the ability to move my boards around so that they don  t just show up as first board made and so on. ','?'
'id: 46337 ',' That having been said, it is still better than the iPhone app is, And since using Pinterest on Safari on the iPad causes Safari to crash all of the time, I  ll take what I can get with the app. ','?'
'id: 46341 ',' I love this app but the new way of pinning things is NOT my favorite! ','?'
'id: 46342 ',' Haven  t had any problems to date, but I  ve only had my phone for a couple of months. ','?'
'id: 46342 ',' I haven  t tried uploading anything but comments and pins are easier to make than on a laptop/desktop. ','?'
'id: 46345 ',' The organization/flow of the app could be improved, as I will often forget how to access or make a task. ','?'
'id: 46353 ',' Not sure what it needs to fix it but these lock ups have to stop. ','?'
'id: 46355 ',' It also crashes about every other time I try to reopen it. ','?'
'id: 46357 ',' It does have its bugs, like freezing when you try to save a picture to your phone sometimes, which is what keeps it from five stars. ','?'
'id: 46359 ',' I really enjoy letting the hours fly by,but I find the app crashes too often. ','?'
'id: 46359 ',' Please fix these glitches. ','?'
'id: 46382 ',' I avoided Pinterest for a while cause I thought I wouldn  t have a use for it but I was totally missing out. ','?'
'id: 46398 ',' Can find everything you didn  t know you wanted or wanted to try! ','?'
'id: 46404 ',' Pinterest, please develop a way for users to download all their recipe boards and make a cookbook out of them! ','?'
'id: 46435 ',' Was there life before pinterest? ','?'
'id: 46437 ',' I think there is a bug. ','?'
'id: 46437 ',' I can  t even open Pinterest anymore and it just keeps trying to update it. ','?'
'id: 46437 ',' I can  t even open the app anymore! ','?'
'id: 46451 ',' Nightly recommend it , ','?'
'id: 46455 ',' Very user friendly and the most addictive app available. ','?'
'id: 46456 ',' Love the ability to like and repin without clicking on the pin, glad they added this feauture back , ','?'
'id: 46474 ',' You then have to search to find out about the item you tapped on to read about , ','?'
'id: 46479 ',' I love Pinterest, but I wish that you could categorize boards and have sub boards. ','?'
'id: 46481 ',' Fills time while I wait for appointments and when I need a smile after a long day. ','?'
'id: 46498 ',' There are so many awesome pictures and ideas and a lot of them have a link to show you how to do it! ','?'
'id: 46504 ',' I absolutely love this app if there anything you want to find or need inspiration just pull up this app and you  ll find everything your looking for and then some , ','?'
'id: 46505 ',' The new way to repin things is terrible. ','?'
'id: 46505 ',' The old way from 2.5 was waaayyyy fast. ','?'
'id: 46505 ',' Please bring it back as an option!!! ','?'
'id: 46506 ',' I love to use Pinterest to plan anything from a wedding to a baby shower! ','?'
'id: 46506 ',' I have never had a problem. ','?'
'id: 46510 ',' Going to echo a lot of what others have mentioned needs fixing, though. ','?'
'id: 46510 ',' The app crashes a lot! ','?'
'id: 46510 ',' Also, it would be awesome to be able to rearrange pins within boards simply by dragging and dropping, as well as rearranging boards the same way (e.g., I want to have all my cooking boards in a row, so I don  t have to scroll way down to check a beef recipe and then way back up to look at the side dish recipe). ','?'
'id: 46510 ',' Another issue is not being able to easily go back and forth between several pins on my boards by swiping or better yet having several smaller windows in one screen. ','?'
'id: 46510 ',' Not sure how to describe this where it makes sense...hopefully you understand what I  m trying to say. ','?'
'id: 46510 ',' One last request, please create an option to select which pins you want to be used as the cover pic for each of the boards, instead of just defaulting to the first pin. ','?'
'id: 46518 ',' You will never need to use your favorites tab again. ','?'
'id: 46525 ',' Pinterest is AWESOME it gives great ideas on how to do things you dont know how to do , ','?'
'id: 46533 ',' Would love to see multiple account support a la Twitter for iOS. ','?'
'id: 46544 ',' Please give me Pinterest back!! ','?'
'id: 46550 ',' Having to re learn how to navigate every time a new upgrade occurs is bothersome, but I love you. ','?'
'id: 46583 ',' It would be nice if it loaded the same way as the website rather than limit the amount you can see in the app. ','?'
'id: 46583 ',' I wish they could add sub folders in each board, like home and then I could break it down by room, etc. , ','?'
'id: 46588 ',' I have had no issues w the updates. ','?'
'id: 46596 ',' The ideas on pintrest are endless. ','?'
'id: 46596 ',' Everyone should have a pintrest account!!! ','?'
'id: 46599 ',' When it  s not crashing on iPad, content is becoming redundant. ','?'
'id: 46600 ',' I love having Pinterest on my phone, but since the latest update that (somewhat) fixed the crashes  I find now that I am unable to open many of the pins from people I follow in order to get to the original source. ','?'
'id: 46600 ',' Good app, but still needs a few more tweaks. ','?'
'id: 46603 ',' And it  s great but you should update it for ice cream sandwich , ','?'
'id: 46608 ',' s mom ,  Not happy that there is NO way to let you know if there is any pins that are distasteful nature. ','?'
'id: 46610 ',' Some are so pixelated that you can  t even tell what they are! ','?'
'id: 46620 ',' Right now I have no problems with the app. ','?'
'id: 46621 ',' Please correct these issues, they are making the app useless. ','?'
'id: 46625 ',' Just hold your thumb on the pi picture and your boards pop up...much easier. ','?'
'id: 46651 ',' I use Pinterest almost daily and would love if there were a way to not have it take up so much storage on my phone. ','?'
'id: 46661 ',' Am I planning a party, needing quick tips for the home, looking for design inspiration, how to save money, recipes, need new makeup tips, or even quick links to personal or health matters? ','?'
'id: 46678 ',' But I think it would be best to have it just shuffle down sequentially, so that a board you used five times ago is in the number five spot and so on. ','?'
'id: 46681 ',' I  m on this app every day multiple times and haven  t had any problems, no glitches at all. ','?'
'id: 46683 ',' I hope  Pinterest is here to stay for many years to come. ','?'
'id: 46687 ',' Only down fall is that It is very distracting from daily activities and has been crashing quite a bit lately. ','?'

'id: 47162 ',' There is no way to upload from photo album iPhone \\nHow can I switch accounts as I help with a few accounts ? ','?'
'id: 47163 ',' The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is I wish you could move pins around in boards and from board to board without having to re pin and delete. ','?'
'id: 47163 ',' It  s frustrating when you realize you can  t find anything in your recipe board because you have so many pins but its too difficult to organize it to find anything. ','?'
'id: 47164 ',' Smoftwo ,  I just updated my app. ','?'
'id: 47169 ',' I do not open the app to see different colored boxes with descriptions of things I can  t see. ','?'

'id: 47175 ',' I also love that I can create my own things to pin. ','?'
'id: 47175 ',' \\nSo why didn  t I give it the full 5 stars? ','?'
'id: 47175 ',' As small as this may seem, I really wish this app would allow us to turn our phone to landscape to see things better and type better. ','?'
'id: 47175 ',' I mean, the phone can do it, and this is an app version of your site for our phone, so why not allow it? ','?'
'id: 47176 ',' The new update has made it so that when I leave the app, even for a few seconds, that when I try to open it again it freezes and kicks me out and makes me start over. ','?'
'id: 47178 ',' Good app but I "updated" it and it has been crashing EVERY time I  m on it, needs an update , ','?'
'id: 47179 ',' \\n\\nIf you are into posting dismembered human bodies, or abused children, or something to do with anger toward ANY religion, they don  t have a problem with it. ','?'
'id: 47181 ',' But I wish there was a way to hash tag my personal crafts to get them out there &amp; seen simply like I would on Instagram. ','?'
'id: 47182 ',' It is not loading pins to browse or updating pins on my feed. ','?'
'id: 47182 ',' It has been happening more frequently since I made the latest update. ','?'
'id: 47182 ',' Evidently there are still some bugs to be worked out. ','?'
'id: 47186 ',' Great, but crashes very regularly. ','?'
'id: 47187 ',' I would be very relieved if I could HIDE a board that has already been created, as opposed to hiding a board before I create it. ','?'
'id: 47189 ',' Dragon654876 ,  Now when I try to pin something I can  t change the board, what gives? ','?'
'id: 47189 ',' Would be nice to pin things to the correct boards!! ','?'

'id: 47236 ',' Boopboolicious1998 ,  Before this last update Pinterest never ever crashed but now if I go on a different app and then go back on to it it freezes my phone then crashes all together, fix that and it will be awesome it works other than that , ','?'
'id: 47237 ',' I love Pinterest and the new updates but seriously why is the "picked for you" section not available on the app yet!? ','?'
'id: 47237 ',' I have to go on my computer if I want to see it, I wish they would fix that , ','?'

'id: 49699 ',' The only thing I don  t like about the app is that it malfunctions a lot and will just shut down from time to time but if you just close the app and open it again it seems to work fine. ','?'
'id: 49701 ',' You need to get it. ','?'
'id: 49711 ',' Just leave a good thing alone !! ','?'
'id: 49712 ',' A Pinterest app that has what you need on the go. ','?'
'id: 49719 ',' Just keep fixing the bugs , ','?'
'id: 49723 ',' I have had no problems. ','?'
'id: 49725 ',' It  s a great app, but every now and then it will crash and kick me out. ','?'
'id: 49735 ',' Never fails! ','?'
'id: 49741 ',' I have to open the app twice to even get to it, and if I was in the middle of browsing there is no way I can get back to where I was. ','?'
'id: 49754 ',' I love the website, but the app has some problems. ','?'
'id: 49754 ',' \\n\\nThe biggest irritants are 1) the app will just close out randomly 2) under profile or on another persons page, the number of followers and how many pins are alway wrong 3) sometimes the "explore" pages will not show anything, just saying "no more pins available". ','?'
'id: 49761 ',' The only way to unfreeze it is to delete the app and reinstall. ','?'
'id: 49763 ',' I can  t figure out how to delete pins. ','?'
'id: 49765 ',' This app is easy to use for anyone even my 7 yr old knows how to find what she  s looking for and pin it! ','?'
'id: 49772 ',' I have no problems with the updates on my iPhone 5. ','?'
'id: 49779 ',' I love pinterest but they need an app for the iPad!!! ','?'
'id: 49785 ',' I have this app on my iPod touch and it crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 49785 ',' \\nI could get used to that however, it never remembers where I was (and sometimes it  s near impossible to find a pin, since they seem to be searched by the description and not tagged.) ','?'
'id: 49785 ',' \\nI am constantly pinning things before reading them, just in case it crashes. ','?'
'id: 49790 ',' There are so many good ideas for every occasion. ','?'
'id: 49792 ',' The only real problem I have with this app is that it takes up 1.9 GB. ','?'
'id: 49792 ',' I keep it because I like it and the safari version on the iPod crashes every time the page loads. ','?'
'id: 49792 ',' If there is any way you can work on the amount of space this app takes up I would be pretty thrilled. ','?'
'id: 49802 ',' But why aren  t my boards automatically arranged in alphabetical order, so I don  t have to search through the entire collection when I want to look at my recipe pins? ','?'
'id: 49805 ',' PC version needs to catch up! ','?'
'id: 49817 ',' It is probably the best app I have on my phone it  s funny and has great tips and tricks for easy ways to organize and other fun things I recommend it!!! ','?'
'id: 49819 ',' The only reason I didn  t give 5 stars is because there are some pics that lead to spam sites or don  t open at all, they need to be more vigilant in removing them. ','?'
'id: 49826 ',' Just wish you could actually buy most of the stuff you see!! ','?'
'id: 49829 ',' The only minor complaint I have is not being able to take my pictures directly from the Facebook app to the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 49830 ',' lol  Great app, you can see how many ppl are so talented, and the newest gadgets all in the same place. ','?'
'id: 49839 ',' Must say though this last update makes it crash and kicks me out completely! ','?'
'id: 49856 ',' I can get my craft ideas on the go and that makes me so happy!? ','?'
'id: 49863 ',' So many great people and ideas are on this app!! ','?'
'id: 49866 ',' I wish there was a way to find my spot quicker. ','?'
'id: 49870 ',' So many wonderful ideas to be found, and then when I want to go back to find something, I only need to go to one site to find what I need! ','?'
'id: 49878 ',' Only complaint is that  it still crashes on me quite often, the stability isn  t the greatest. ','?'
'id: 49878 ',' The more boards I create and add pins to them, the more people are following me and repinning my own pins. ','?'
'id: 49902 ',' Jessiemeza ,  Love it I can  t stop pinning lol , ','?'
'id: 49904 ',' \\n I recommend to try it out! ','?'
'id: 49913 ',' I HATE HATE the fact that it continually crashes. ','?'
'id: 49933 ',' can  t delete the app, can  t use it, very disappointing. ','?'
'id: 49942 ',' I love that I can get help when I need ideas for recipes. ','?'
'id: 49955 ',' I mostly use it on my computer, but if I need it all of the apps work just fine! ','?'
'id: 49968 ',' Though it crashes every once in a while, I highly recommend this app to everyone and anyone I know. ','?'
'id: 49971 ',' \\n\\nAlthough, I  m still a rookie and don  t understand why it times out and stops allowing me to view pins after only a few minutes? ','?'
'id: 49978 ',' I like that I can view a pic up close, then just slide it to the left so I can go back to what I was doing before. ','?'
'id: 49986 ',' Love the site, however it crashes all the time on my I Pad, very frustrating. ','?'
'id: 50230 ',' While I like the great ideas that come up, I think the site would be better if there was a way to select what you didn  t want to see. ','?'
'id: 50230 ',' I am not interested in spending hours on my nails, I think tattoos are ugly, and I shouldn  t have to see naked people when I am looking for furniture ideas. ','?'
'id: 50231 ',' But it crashes my iPod and the lates update was terrible! ','?'
'id: 50231 ',' please fix it! ','?'
'id: 50233 ',' So many ideas and how to  s OMG I can  t get enough! ','?'
'id: 50234 ',' Never had a problem on any device I own, sooo addicting! ','?'
'id: 50244 ',' Please add a "move" button. ','?'
'id: 50254 ',' Love pinterest  s great ideas and various crafts! ','?'
'id: 50255 ',' I like Pinterest itself, but the app could use some work like maybe being able to see what pins you have commented on, and not kicking you out of the app every 45 minutes. ','?'
'id: 50259 ',' Never has a problem and it never force closes. ','?'
'id: 50275 ',' The most recent update adding the ability to edit your boards made this app better. ','?'
'id: 50276 ',' What was life like before pinterest? ','?'
'id: 50288 ',' There are ideas for crafts, food and school!! ','?'
'id: 50299 ',' However, I find it does crash now &amp; again. ','?'
'id: 50299 ',' You used to be able copy &amp; paste recipes but that feature is no longer available, I would like that back. ','?'
'id: 50304 ',' The one thing it (and the website) could use is a feature allowing for seperate categories within a board. ','?'
'id: 50304 ',' I still love the app though and will always have it on my phone. ','?'
'id: 50320 ',' There are so many awesome ideas on here a person should never be bored with this app. ','?'
'id: 50328 ',' I always find myself on this app; it gives me great ideas about everything from clothes to food to home decor; I can  t stop ? ','?'
'id: 50330 ',' Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants ideas for anything! ','?'
'id: 50331 ',' I just love this app. ','?'
'id: 50331 ',' My Grammy just got this on her kindle fire and she has a hard time understanding how to get and search for pins. ','?'
'id: 50333 ',' I have an iPhone 5 and have had very scattered problems with it crashing. ','?'
'id: 50347 ',' Jragarza ,  I have noticed some of my pins are missing tho. ','?'
'id: 50359 ',' Never thought I would really use Pinterest but now some days I am addicted to it. ','?'
'id: 50361 ',' Still crashes even after the recent update. ','?'
'id: 50362 ',' Love everything ab the app just hate when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 50365 ',' My only issue is the 3 board limit on the boards you can make secret. ','?'
'id: 50366 ',' David Montemurri ,  I just love it! ','?'
'id: 50384 ',' Have been upset for weeks, l love the Pintrest idea but there are so many great pins from UTube and still can NOT pin direct to the video on IPad. ','?'
'id: 50384 ',' They think it  s fixed ( or more likely they can  t fix) and keep blowing me off. ','?'
'id: 50389 ',' I  m new to Pinterest but I love having a place to go to find ideas, recipes etc and then having somewhere I can keep it and go back when ever I need it!!! ','?'
'id: 50412 ',' I think I need a pintervention. ','?'
'id: 50433 ',' I just love it. ','?'
'id: 50439 ',' The only downside is that I can easily waste a couple of hours just pinning all the things. ','?'
'id: 50442 ',' Being able to catalog items and ideas that are specific to you is wonderful! ','?'
'id: 50444 ',' It does crash every once and a while, but I still use it almost every day. ','?'
'id: 50451 ',' I haven  t had any problems with this app! ','?'
'id: 50454 ',' Its better than what I expected, I would strongly recommend to any and everyone. ','?'
'id: 50459 ',' I haven  t had any major issues with it. ','?'
'id: 50476 ',' I just wish we could have unlimited or at least MORE secret boards! ','?'
'id: 50479 ',' Deleted and just put a bookmark to the we site on my home page. ','?'
'id: 50483 ',' How could a Pinterest app be anything but amazing? ','?'
'id: 50494 ',' Great app \\nLike the content\\nBut need to be more stable , ','?'
'id: 50508 ',' I recommend it to everyone. ','?'
'id: 50511 ',' \\n\\nIt crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 50514 ',' Does sometime spontaneously crash. ','?'
'id: 50521 ',' :) even if it has some bugs and shuts down occasionally, it  s always fixed the same day, so you can keep pinning. ','?'
'id: 50522 ',' I love this app when I am in line or have to wait for something because it makes time fly! ','?'
'id: 50526 ',' Love Pinterest...but when you try to copy a pic, either it won  t let you or it  s too big for Instagram...my only complaint! ','?'
'id: 50543 ',' After all the updates I can no longer see how to email a pin. ','?'
'id: 50562 ',' I like Pinterest but I think we should have the option to choose if we want to have the changes/updates. ','?'
'id: 50575 ',' Pretty much everything you need is in the app! ','?'
'id: 50576 ',' Blah723456 ,  It crashes a little too often for my liking. ','?'
'id: 50581 ',' It provides a great deal of information that I need! ','?'
'id: 50581 ',' It also provides me a nice place to escape while the love of my life is deployed! ','?'
'id: 50597 ',' Lately it hasn  t been informing me if I  ve already pinned a pin though and it would be nice if that could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 50597 ',' But if we could have at least one or two more that would be perfect. ','?'
'id: 50599 ',' I can t get enough good recipes and tips from this app :) , ','?'
'id: 50606 ',' I  ve probably confused a few of these scenarios because this is all more complicated than it needs to be. ','?'
'id: 50615 ',' Sometimes the app crashes, but not too often. ','?'
'id: 50627 ',' I keep checking everyday it  s not fun if you don  t know how to use it so make u take the steps they give seriously lol , ','?'
'id: 50633 ',' Didn  t, get it at first....but now just love it! ','?'
'id: 50636 ',' I recommend it to everyone! ','?'
'id: 50641 ',' Love it but sometimes it crashes on me. ','?'
'id: 50646 ',' I could care less if and when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 50654 ',' Only problem is that it  s addicting &lt;3 , ','?'
'id: 50657 ',' Even when there is a bug they put an update up as quick as they can. ','?'
'id: 50665 ',' But it crashes sometimes. ','?'
'id: 50666 ',' I use to love Pinterest but now I can  t even pin anything else without getting a pop up saying I  ve exceeded my pin limit. ','?'
'id: 50666 ',' What  s the point in having a PINterest if we can  t pin what we like?! ','?'
'id: 50666 ',' Please get this issue fixed so I can go back to enjoying this app again. ','?'
'id: 50667 ',' The only thing they really need to add is a way to organize boards into categories. ','?'
'id: 50667 ',' I have 6 different photography related boards that could be put under one heading of "photography". ','?'
'id: 50669 ',' My only issue is that every 30 or so minutes, the app crashes :(. ','?'
'id: 50669 ',' It usually crashes while I  m in the middle of pinning something and then I have the trouble of searching for the pin that I wanted to pin in the first place. ','?'
'id: 50676 ',' At first there were a few issues with it , but it appears as tho the bugs are now worked out pretty well. ','?'
'id: 50692 ',' It crashes anytime I try to repin anything. ','?'
'id: 50693 ',' I like Pinterest, and the app just gives me inspiration on the go! ','?'
'id: 50715 ',' Why does Pinterest Crash every 10 15 min on IPad &amp; forget about opening up easily on IPhone, why does that take forever even when updating the app often? ','?'
'id: 50726 ',' I use it daily and it never fails me. ','?'
'id: 50726 ',' I recommend his to everyone. ','?'
'id: 50736 ',' I do wish there was a way to report spam links from my iPhone. ','?'
'id: 50736 ',' I feel that if I want to email a particular secret pin, I should be allowed to divulge that   secret   to whomever I  m trying to email it to. ','?'
'id: 50746 ',' Please don  t ever go away! ','?'
'id: 50770 ',' This a great app in general but especially for busy working moms who need ideas to spice up dinner choices! ','?'
'id: 50777 ',' My only complaint: how to pin on the phone, if there is no pin button. ','?'
'id: 50778 ',' They did make my acct read only and I never got the email that told me this information so it was a pain to figure out how to get it back to normal. ','?'
'id: 50790 ',' I have thrown the best birthday parties, decorated my house, made the best food and so much more all by myself thanks to the ideas and tutorials on here! ','?'
'id: 50805 ',' What ever you want or need is here!!!!! ','?'
'id: 50809 ',' Sure it  s got some bugs but people are just looking to be critical. ','?'
'id: 50822 ',' I  m new to it so still trying to figure out a few things but I like it...after I  ve mastered this I  ll be able to better access the workology of this app, thus far it  s cool...and yes I made up a word! ','?'
'id: 50827 ',' I have had no problems so far. ','?'
'id: 50839 ',' Makes using the app for recipes (or other things that you need to go back to the site for the instructions) pointless. ','?'
'id: 50880 ',' It has soooo many ideas, crafts, hobbys, etc. it crashes on rare occasions, but otherwise, it  s GREAT!!! ','?'
'id: 50890 ',' It is missing a few features that the normal website has, but they are pretty minimal. ','?'
'id: 50898 ',' Love Pinterest, just wish there was a way to put boards into folders. ','?'
'id: 50900 ',' What a great way to share ideas and how to  s with the world! ','?'
'id: 50907 ',' It crashes a lot and sometimes it will not log in. ','?'
'id: 50922 ',' Pinterest is great for finding out about everything you want to know from food, fitness, fashion, etc. , ','?'
'id: 50930 ',' I love the app but I have a limit of how much I can pin? ','?'
'id: 50931 ',' Only bug that I com across is that sometimes Pinterest deletes some of your pins. ','?'
'id: 50931 ',' Either way, it  s still a great app. ','?'
'id: 50933 ',' I love that you can find everything right here, whether its remodeling your room or getting ideas for a wedding it  s all here! ','?'
'id: 50934 ',' And having an app so I can use it anywhere is great! ','?'
'id: 50945 ',' Some great ideas, but have had some issues , ','?'
'id: 50960 ',' Thanks to Pinterest I  mbsleep deprived and my hubby is starting to get annoyed by me saying " Ohh we need to do this or I  ve gotta make a run to Hobby Lobby for a "few" things! ','?'
'id: 50965 ',' Haven  t had any issues with it thus far. ','?'
'id: 50965 ',' It updates my home board with new pins within seconds, and the UI is really user friendly and easy to use. ','?'
'id: 50970 ',' My only complaint is that I can  t find my bestfriend when I need to send her something! ','?'
'id: 50970 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 50976 ',' It is also a great thing if you are having to sit and wait somewhere; it makes time go by much faster! ','?'
'id: 50980 ',' I like how they added the recently viewed catagory! ','?'
'id: 50991 ',' I love the Pinterest App for my iPhone 5 never had any pinning or loading problems , ','?'
'id: 50996 ',' It has crashed only once the entire time I have had it. ','?'
'id: 51004 ',' The way it was. ','?'
'id: 51005 ',' This provides me with a great amount of ideas! ','?'
'id: 51006 ',' It dies seem to crash quite a bit which gets frustrating. ','?'
'id: 51020 ',' The two wishes would be less crashing and the ability to pin things from online vs. just from other pinners. ','?'
'id: 51025 ',' Do not enjoy the spams( pinterest needs to counter that better). ','?'
'id: 51025 ',' Also, pinterest needs to help block/ invisibility to select few available even if its there its unclear! ','?'
'id: 51027 ',' Great app, never crashes. ','?'
'id: 51029 ',' The friend should have the ability to view the pin and decide whether she would like to add it to her board. ','?'
'id: 51030 ',' Love it especially when I  m bored sometimes it crashes when you pin way too much at one time. ','?'
'id: 51032 ',' Never had a problem with it on my iPhone 5 , ','?'
'id: 51034 ',' I have only had one problem, and they corrected it right away. ','?'
'id: 51036 ',' \\n\\nBe sure to read how to add "pin it" button to browser favorites when cruising outside of Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 51038 ',' It  s perfect for what I need it for. ','?'
'id: 51039 ',' For those who say it crashes all the time it  s because you probably need to delete all the dumb games you have in what ever stupid device you have. ','?'
'id: 51045 ',' The only thing I don  t like is when you have so many pins and can only see the last 15 you posted. ','?'
'id: 51045 ',' Next update please change this. ','?'
'id: 51046 ',' So it  s hard to explain how to do this with others with a limit on the characters you can use. ','?'
'id: 51064 ',' Any idea you need is here. ','?'
'id: 51089 ',' It will from time to time crash &amp; forseclose or will not load properly when pining something, all In all great app! ','?'
'id: 51091 ',' Have had it on my iphone for months and never had any issues with it. ','?'

'id: 51101 ',' The app does crash sometimes, but nothing a true Pinterest lover can  t look over! ','?'
'id: 51112 ',' I can understand censoring porno, but nude art is an essential part of creative expression   you have to be able to differentiate! ','?'
'id: 51117 ',' Also can  t seem to figure out how to load the pin badge on to my IPAD. ','?'
'id: 51123 ',' I never seem to have a problem with it crashing. ','?'
'id: 51125 ',' And see what my daughters interests and style ideas are on a more current basis. ','?'

'id: 51233 ',' I use this to plan pretty much everything now and Im on it even more than Facebook. ','?'
'id: 51234 ',' Ok so they really need to fix the glitch where no matter HOW many FRIGGIN times I unfollow a person their STUPID post still keep SHOWING UP ON MY HOME PAGE!!!!! ','?'
'id: 51234 ',' \\n5 stars if next time I update this app the unfollowing thing is fixed. ','?'
'id: 51238 ',' Make sure you have a ton of time to look around because before you know it your pinning for hours. ','?'
'id: 51239 ',' Great idea, but the app crashes a bit. ','?'
'id: 51255 ',' I never have any problems using it either. ','?'
'id: 51256 ',' All the apps on my iPad have some issues, so if they are too annoying I delete them. ','?'
'id: 51257 ',' I use this app so much to find anything I want to learn how to do. ','?'
'id: 51257 ',' I love the secret boards option, but we should be allowed more than 4. ','?'
'id: 51262 ',' Not a gamer, love having this when I  m waiting and need to kill time. ','?'
'id: 51263 ',' Please reinstate this feature so I don  t repin unnecessarily. ','?'
'id: 51265 ',' It  s easy to use and never has crashed on me. ','?'
'id: 51266 ',' This is a good way to share ideas for home projects, style you might have in common , place you might want to visit or dream you could visit. ','?'
'id: 51280 ',' As far as I can tell, though, you still have to go to the full site to change board covers. ','?'
'id: 51280 ',' I wish this functionality was available when pinning regularly. ','?'
'id: 51281 ',' I think if that feature was added I would update my rating to 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 51285 ',' The more features, the more issues but overall it  s great, you just have to have patience with the crashes. ','?'
'id: 51287 ',' I got the CPU version first and then I added the app to my phone. ','?'
'id: 51287 ',' I haven  t had any issues with it yet! ','?'
'id: 51289 ',' Every girl needs this app. ','?'
'id: 51295 ',' The only down side is that I can  t buy a majority of the products that I pin. ','?'
'id: 51295 ',' Which doesn  t make applications like Wanelo any better. ','?'
'id: 51298 ',' I have made many a recipe and they have been delish! ','?'
'id: 51304 ',' I really like the new update where you can just hold down the pin and choose what you would like to do, without having to open it. ','?'
'id: 51310 ',' But I can  t figure out how to search my own pins, I always see it on the update but I can never do it. ','?'
'id: 51312 ',' I have an iPhone 4 and have no problems with it. ','?'
'id: 51314 ',' I made some awesome thing and not so awesome things. ','?'

'id: 51363 ',' Andie@BB ,  I hate finding great ideas in a magazine only to not be able to find it when I need it. ','?'
'id: 51363 ',' I only post things I  ll use. ','?'
'id: 51369 ',' The app is amazing, and the best part is that they continue to update it by answering all our prayers and fixing any problem that we see. ','?'
'id: 51370 ',' I loved being able to just save the pics to my iPod but now I can  t do that and it  s stupid that they changed it even though it was just fine! ','?'
'id: 51372 ',' The only comment I have is that sometimes pictures don  t load or take a very long time to load or sometimes it crashes. ','?'
'id: 51372 ',' This could have more to do with the websites themselves rather than the app, but just something to note. ','?'
'id: 51376 ',' Works well see you can take your obsession with you wherever you go! ','?'
'id: 51381 ',' What did we do before Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 51388 ',' Amazing I have found so many thing on here I pretty much planned my wedding with Pinterest love it and tell everyone about it , ','?'

'id: 51394 ',' It would be cool if under the edit board button you had the option to select all the pictures that you would want to move to another board. ','?'
'id: 51398 ',' I don  t like the fact of some of the language that is now on some of the pins not appropriate for my teenager to be seeing or myself for that matter , ','?'
'id: 51407 ',' any hints? ','?'
'id: 51410 ',' I found out how to get the gum off following a post from someone. ','?'
'id: 51416 ',' Never had issues like with other apps, doesn  t crash or is slow. ','?'
'id: 51434 ',' Only problem is that it closes unexpectedly. ','?'
'id: 51442 ',' The one thing I don  t like is that it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 51444 ',' Magnessy ,  I love this app, my only problem is that I can never see all my liked pictures, it will refresh somehow, or something like that while I  m scrolling down and it will go to the top of the list of pictures. ','?'
'id: 51444 ',' Please fix that. ','?'
'id: 51446 ',' I like how you can find almost anything, and whatever you find, Pinterest will show you things that are related. ','?'

'id: 51685 ',' Instead of making faster to share they need to focus on functionality and some customer service. ','?'
'id: 51696 ',' It  s very easy to use, one flaw, you can  t unfollow once you follow a pinner. ','?'
'id: 51702 ',' The app itself works great and hasn  t froze or failed me yet! ','?'
'id: 51715 ',' The idea behind it, the way it  s organized, almost everything about Pinterest is amazing. ','?'
'id: 51715 ',' The ONLY reason I am not giving the APP five stars, is a few little bugs and the occasional crash. ','?'

'id: 51795 ',' This is a marvelous concept whoever came up with it is brilliant, and I recommend it to everyone!!!! ','?'
'id: 51799 ',' Only thing I wish the app would allow us to do is delete or move a pin to a different board. ','?'

'id: 51806 ',' All that needs to be said. ','?'
'id: 51814 ',' How did I ever live w/o it? ','?'

'id: 51869 ',' If you are looking for a great app stop your search you just found it! ','?'

'id: 51874 ',' \\nEither way this app is the best, I can live with its flaws because it  s the best app ever. ','?'
'id: 51877 ',' And the last couple updates have caused it to crash every time I try to view a pin. ','?'
'id: 51879 ',' The app crashes when I pin from a website and the touch and hold to pin or share and whatever isn  t that great. ','?'
'id: 51881 ',' And I luv the new update, cuz it made it easier to pin things!! ','?'
'id: 51881 ',' Cuz it would be nice to be able to do things when u r on vacation and don  t have any wifi/ Internet! ','?'
'id: 51882 ',' It would also be nice if my boards could be categorized according to subject so that I could look under a subject when searching for a particular pin , ','?'
'id: 51883 ',' However this latest update crashed my iPad mini to the point that I couldn  t even turn it on! ','?'
'id: 51886 ',' And the app crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 51886 ',' The app just annoys me. ','?'
'id: 51891 ',' Why don  t you just roll back to the version before June 18th before all the complaints and fire the programmers that are rolling out these poorly tested updates? ','?'

'id: 51951 ',' The app has improved but still needs some work  doesn  t allow you to edit pins on the app &amp; when looking at the boards you think you  ve seen all the pins but if u go online you  ll notice the board actually has more pins. ','?'
'id: 51952 ',' No problems with this app until the last update, now it crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 51953 ',' I can  t even look at the photos!!! ','?'
'id: 51961 ',' Hopefully crashes have been fixed as they were very frustrating. ','?'

'id: 51974 ',' I used to be able to click on the pin and it would take me to the link, now it just displays the pin, send, etc. , ','?'
'id: 51975 ',' Please either fix the sensitivity of this feature or allow us to disable it if we choose. ','?'
'id: 51981 ',' While I do like the most recent features, it has been crashing a fair bit. ','?'
'id: 51982 ',' The only concern that I have is that I wish that you could pick and decide want you want the cover picture for the board to be. ','?'

'id: 51984 ',' Please add that back. ','?'

'id: 51994 ',' I want to choose where the pin is going and know its going to the right board so I can find it again. ','?'
'id: 51994 ',' Now, it takes me an extra step again since you have to open the pin first and then pin from there to choose the board. ','?'
'id: 51996 ',' I love the app and Pinterest but I don  t need an email every time someone repins one of my pins. ','?'
'id: 52003 ',' Love Pinterest but adding a lot of changes that are not all good i don  t like how it list how many pins there are on a board because now i realize i don  t bother looking at others if they don  t have a lot which is silly!! ','?'
'id: 52003 ',' Also it CONTINUES to crash every 30 40 mins on my iPad AND iPhone :( , ','?'

'id: 55386 ',' Works well with few crashes. ','?'
'id: 55392 ',' I use the application every day and have no problems with it except for occasional response delays and even more rare app crashes, but I think that weaker Internet connection plays a role with these, instead of it just being an error with the app. ','?'

'id: 57435 ',' IT LITERALLY CRASHED FIVE TIMES THIS MORNING! ','?'
'id: 57460 ',' I try not to spend too much time on this app but I do love it! ','?'

'id: 57492 ',' I  ve gotten so many great ideas for my house and classroom just from seeing what other people are doing. ','?'
'id: 57494 ',' Informative, I need to put some of this information to use. ','?'
'id: 57496 ',' Occasionally has a glitch or two but few and far between \\nOverall an awesome website turned app\\nNo place better to find a million cool ideas and things all in one place \\nI  m convinced that if you can  t fid something on Pintrest it  s because it does not exist , ','?'
'id: 57506 ',' I highly recommend Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 57523 ',' Overall quick and useful, my only complaint is that the newest version I have used you have to click on a pin to repin it, whereas before you could like or repin without doing this by clicking on a small icon below the pin. ','?'
'id: 57525 ',' Used to love it ......until 90% of my pins disappeared.......what happened?? ','?'
'id: 57549 ',' The app is great and all but, I think there should be a One Direction category. ','?'
'id: 57560 ',' I just love Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 57565 ',' There are so many creative ideas on here. ','?'
'id: 57567 ',' Some of the most beautiful and awesome pictures are here for me to pin and enjoy! ','?'
'id: 57580 ',' It crashes after about 5 10 minutes. ','?'
'id: 57589 ',' I love it but annoying when it  s stops loading others pins in a category and you have to exit and go back in , ','?'
'id: 57592 ',' I love being able to share great ideas and how to  s with others. ','?'
'id: 57599 ',' I love the way the layout is placed, and there are so many ideas. ','?'
'id: 57602 ',' It is a little annoying to have to open the photo to be able to like it, but pinning is easy as you just have to hold your finger on it for a second and choose the board. ','?'
'id: 57604 ',' Ugh love looking and pinning but all of my memory is used up and when i want to retrieve something I can  t search with in my pages so. ','?'
'id: 57608 ',' Tons and tons of fun stuff, never know what you are going to find. ','?'
'id: 57631 ',' I don  t really care about the space it takes up and so what if you have to click on the pic to like it, what  s one second. ','?'
'id: 57636 ',' I have had absolutely no problems with this app. ','?'
'id: 57636 ',' Sure, it takes up a lot of room on whichever device you  re installing it on, but that  s to be expected when you can go on this site and lean how to cool a five star meal, make the best margarita anyone will ever have, plan the cutest outfit, create a collage out of something you thought was trash, decorate your house to be the cutest thing in the world, make a new face mask, and anything else you can think of. ','?'
'id: 57639 ',' I just love Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 57646 ',' I need more time in the day to make all the great ideas I found! ','?'
'id: 57671 ',' It is addicting &amp; can therefore be time consuming but in a good way since you  re only looking at information that is of interest to you vs looking it up online where you then have to sort through various sites of information that may or may not be specifically what you are looking for depending on how it  s linked to your key word. ','?'
'id: 57684 ',' \\n\\nUpdate on my review:\\nAfter a couple of updates, this still crashes when I go to the source. ','?'
'id: 57686 ',' Pinterest has also showed me how to get rid of some of that tension in my upper back and tips on studying. ','?'
'id: 57693 ',' I think there should be a way to repin everything in someone else  s board. ','?'
'id: 57694 ',' Heymo ,  I  m an addict, old or new version, I just love this app! ','?'
'id: 57704 ',' This is one of the best apps you could add to your phone or tablet. ','?'
'id: 57706 ',' Just wish the links from pins worked more consistently. ','?'
'id: 57709 ',' What in the world did we ever do before Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 57710 ',' Just keep pinning!! ','?'
'id: 57714 ',' You have to fix this. ','?'
'id: 57715 ',' It crashes in the middle of browsing boards, makes it hard to find something you were just about to repin. ','?'
'id: 57717 ',' Please fix it so it doesn  t crash so often though. ','?'
'id: 57721 ',' I just need to let you guys know that this app is excellent. ','?'
'id: 57721 ',' They need to make a way to allow you to directly pin something by upload or linking. ','?'
'id: 57721 ',' As it is right now, you have to go in a round about way of doing such a simple task. ','?'
'id: 57721 ',' The web version doesn  t force us to jump through hoops, why should this app? ','?'
'id: 57724 ',' Love the app but it crashes too often. ','?'
'id: 57724 ',' I enjoy exploring until it crashes again. ','?'
'id: 57726 ',' I can  t look at any pins without it crashing! ','?'
'id: 57727 ',' Why isn  t there an iPad integrated share button from the safari share? ','?'
'id: 57739 ',' Pintrest has become my vision board, my wish list, and my "can  t forget how to do that" board that is right at my finger tips! ','?'
'id: 57744 ',' Almost in love but a lot of the links won  t load or load but aren  t functional needs a little work. ','?'
'id: 57750 ',' I get spend so much time just searching everything I can think of on here. ','?'
'id: 57761 ',' However I do not like how you have to click on the picture to pin something now! ','?'
'id: 57764 ',' Just don  t understand why they limit how many boards you can create. ','?'
'id: 57767 ',' Do you think that the people who made this app were like "gosh people are going to use this for hours so lets make it crash every 20 minutes and crash if  they scroll too fast" or do you think they just can  t figure out how to fix it? ','?'
'id: 57767 ',' Either way it  s super annoying! ','?'
'id: 57768 ',' The only problem I have is that I  ve been sucked in and it  s so addicting! ','?'
'id: 57768 ',' If you decide to make soap please use an electric grater. ','?'
'id: 57769 ',' I love the fact that you can create multiple boards and have Public and Private ones , ','?'
'id: 57772 ',' Please reverse it back to where you could like a picture without opening it. ','?'
'id: 57773 ',' Love this app but it has been crashing a lot lately. ','?'
'id: 57779 ',' Mimipapageorgio ,  This a pretty great app, but it doesn  t load all of my pins and it has crashed more times than I care to think about. ','?'
'id: 57779 ',' I find it very inconvenient to have to click on the pin so I can like it. ','?'
'id: 57788 ',' Once you start you can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 57788 ',' There are great ideas out there. ','?'
'id: 57796 ',' Memory hog, but I don  t think you can get around that. ','?'
'id: 57802 ',' I don  t have time to wright a review, I need to get back to Pintrest cause I might miss something! ','?'
'id: 57812 ',' Use it for planning home decor, bookmarking "How To" informational references as well as design inspirations! ','?'
'id: 57813 ',' you can find anything you need! ','?'
'id: 57826 ',' Please HELP with MEMORY?! ','?'
'id: 57828 ',' Pininterest  still crashes sometimes when you are on it or open it. ','?'
'id: 57828 ',' And it has bugs on it they need to assess the whole app and fix what needs to be fixed. ','?'
'id: 57828 ',' Next they need to improve how it lets you search your pins because some times it doesn  t work. ','?'
'id: 57828 ',' Lastly they need a better filter when you search pins most of the time half the pins on the page are not related to your search or repetitive. ','?'
'id: 57828 ',' If they don  t fix it soon I  m considering deleting because its been a while and nothing has been fixed, added, or improved! ','?'
'id: 57838 ',' Love that I can add my own pics! ','?'
'id: 57838 ',' App crashes when I use it a lot. ','?'
'id: 57839 ',' Great app but sometimes when I am looking at pins the app crashes and when I reopen the app I can  t find what I was looking at. ','?'
'id: 57840 ',' You can use it for everything!! ','?'
'id: 57842 ',' Pinterest seems to forget me from one device to the next. ','?'
'id: 57843 ',' I just hope the links to my pins don  t get lost!! ','?'
'id: 57845 ',' Just love it! ','?'
'id: 57845 ',' But I feel like something  s missing. ','?'
'id: 57845 ',' I don  t know what, it just is , ','?'
'id: 57847 ',' I just wish there was a way it would eliminate pins I already have. ','?'
'id: 57851 ',' I use this app the most on my phone...if I  m at the market and need a quick grocery list, if I  m brainstorming for different projects..anything really..this app is the best , ','?'
'id: 57852 ',' The cache of memory takes up gigs of space until you have to delete the app and reinstall. ','?'
'id: 57853 ',' When you have multiple pages open, you can swipe from right to left to go back a page, but there  s no way to go from left to right. ','?'
'id: 57853 ',' \\n\\nI recommend getting it, it works well for browsing. ','?'
'id: 57854 ',' For example, you start a "recipes" board and it starts to be so big that you want to subdivide it into "desserts," "vegetables," etc. ','?'
'id: 57858 ',' My one problem is that sometimes, when it is loading pins, it will just quit on me. ','?'
'id: 57863 ',' I have created things from this site, I have cooked new recipes that became a hit from this site, and I have discovered new things I love from this site. ','?'
'id: 57887 ',' I have so much fun on Pinterest, I forget the time!! ','?'
'id: 57898 ',' But whenever I click on a big picture like a tutorial or something it just automatically crashes! ','?'
'id: 57898 ',' I don  t know if it has to do with the size of the picture or the loading, but I do get a little tired of it crashing when I  m trying to read something. ','?'
'id: 57905 ',' Just two things: (1) the links from some pictures have stopped working, and (2) we need a way to recover tabs that we slide to the left. ','?'
'id: 57908 ',' Please bring back the like button without having to open the whole posted pin. ','?'
'id: 57908 ',' I already wasted enough time on here, I don  t need to open the pin to know I like it. ','?'
'id: 57918 ',' For the people complaining about this update taking away the like button, all you have to do to pin is hold down on the picture and the shortcut pinning menu will come up. ','?'
'id: 57919 ',' I don  t think you can create original pins on the app like you can online but that  s about my only complaint , ','?'
'id: 57923 ',' Please allow screen rotation in future release. ','?'
'id: 57931 ',' Good app, I recommend it. ','?'
'id: 57932 ',' You must download! ','?'
'id: 57941 ',' Latest version needs to get the bug out that keeps randomly dumping me out. ','?'

'id: 57995 ',' However, I don  t love how you can  t scroll indefinitely anymore. ','?'
'id: 57998 ',' I love the app and recommend it all the time. ','?'
'id: 57998 ',' I almost forgot to mention the diy section. ','?'
'id: 58006 ',' It just takes away some of the fun when it becomes a chore to share things on your page. ','?'
'id: 58007 ',' I marvel at how talented people are and it provides me with a daily dose of creativity and ingenuity ! ','?'
'id: 58009 ',' It has created an amazing platform for collaborating with other classroom teachers. ','?'
'id: 58030 ',' The only problem with Pinterest is that it is so addicting! ','?'
'id: 58030 ',' And you actually don  t have to make the picture big to repin it on the new format, you just have to hold your finger on the picture for a second and it will repin it! ','?'
'id: 58039 ',' I can sort all my ideas into categories and I never forget a DIY project anymore! ','?'
'id: 58041 ',' I especially use it for craft ideas, but love it equally to track various things I just love: furniture, jewelry, fashion, vintage items, etc.\\n\\nThe mobile app works just as well for my needs as the desktop version. ','?'
'id: 58048 ',' Pinterest has everything I need! ','?'
'id: 58049 ',' One of my favorite apps just takes up too much memory. ','?'
'id: 58050 ',' I would like to have the like option back :D , ','?'
'id: 58053 ',' The app works well and provides a convenient way to kill time. ','?'
'id: 58062 ',' It  s very user friendly &amp; I just love the beautiful pics that you have access to. ','?'

'id: 58074 ',' \\n\\nLove Pinterest but please fix glitch oh and the like and pin button on the image would be amazing so you don  t have  to click on it would be amazing , ','?'
'id: 58095 ',' How did I ever survive before Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 58096 ',' The mobile app still has some bugs to work out but it improves greatly with each update. ','?'

'id: 58116 ',' Love pinterest for ideas on how to decorate our new home. ','?'
'id: 58118 ',' Never thought I could get so addicted! ','?'
'id: 58123 ',' It  s a fun app until it crashes. ','?'
'id: 58139 ',' Photos fail on upload sometimes. ','?'
'id: 58146 ',' this update is awesome but I wish there was an easier way to like the pic. ','?'
'id: 58147 ',' My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that it crashes a lot and when it does you can  t go back to the same place you were at when it shut down without warning. ','?'
'id: 58147 ',' My other complaint is that they don  t have enough categories in any version and many of them are mixed, again in any version, so you have to wade through a lot of stuff you don  t like to find the category you do. ','?'
'id: 58148 ',' If you are stuck and need any ideas on just about anything Pinterest is it!! ','?'
'id: 58152 ',' I think you should totally get this app! ','?'
'id: 58156 ',' I like the fixes they made. ','?'
'id: 58157 ',' I truly heart this powerful app except that it crashes quite frequently. ','?'
'id: 58158 ',' Yes it gives u lovely nail hair food tatoo and room ideas but it unbelievably addicting and u wish u could have the rooms and I get so jealous but yes it  s a great app I gave it four stars because nothing  s perfect like it does take up a lot of memory , ','?'
'id: 58172 ',' I wish there was a way you could search our own pins for items. ','?'
'id: 58175 ',' Never crashes! ','?'
'id: 58184 ',' Awesome tips it is so good that the people post they just are fantastic they help me out so much with all the ideas I made some and I loved it Pinterest I give a 5 star rating !!!!!! ','?'
'id: 58191 ',' I think it  s a great app but I think you should be able to combine 2 or more boards together if you would like to, because if you have 2 boards that are a lot alike and you just want to combine them together, no one would want to go through and edit or repin all their pins from one board to the other. ','?'
'id: 58202 ',' Memory space can be an issue. ','?'
'id: 58205 ',' And I love that I can use it on the go. ','?'
'id: 58205 ',' I used to hate the app because it crashed all the time. ','?'
'id: 58205 ',' So glad that bug has been fixed. ','?'
'id: 58222 ',' I am also an iPhone user that prefers landscape view which I can  t on your app. ','?'
'id: 58225 ',' ,  You need this for everyday rituals to make life easy at any age! ','?'
'id: 58232 ',' \\nI do wish there was a way to eliminate so many multiple pins popping up for the same recipe. ','?'
'id: 58232 ',' \\nMaybe if there was a way to have them all link together or something. ','?'
'id: 58240 ',' The basic functions for adding and deleting your pins are easy to figure out, and the concept of the site is useful for creating side by side comparisons of things you might like to buy. ','?'
'id: 58241 ',' Especially if you forgot your list if you  re doing a craft or such,  you can just grab it off the app. ','?'
'id: 58248 ',' This is a problem I have more often than I  d like to admit, but it really isn  t a problem anymore. ','?'
'id: 58255 ',' I have tried updating and reinstalling, and I still get the same error. ','?'
'id: 58256 ',' It is great to explore when you are somewhere you have to wait, like the doctor  s office. ','?'
'id: 58270 ',' I would say that 90% of the time it crashes. ','?'
'id: 58271 ',' Love Pinterest but agree with other reviewers that the last app update took away desired functionality now that you have to click to open the item before you can like it. ','?'

'id: 58340 ',' It still crashes, but not as much as it used to. ','?'
'id: 58344 ',' One thing, can you figure out how to make it not crash so much? ','?'
'id: 58344 ',' I mean at times, RIGHT when I want to "like", comment, repin or share a picture, it crashes at really bad times!! ','?'
'id: 58345 ',' Would be nice to be able to move the pins around to order them as your most to least favorite or whatever. ','?'
'id: 58350 ',' I loved Pinterest until I updated it. ','?'
'id: 58350 ',' Its so frustrating when it crashes (which happens more than any other app on my phone) because I have to scroll through all of the pins that I have already looked at to find the new ones...its too slow and does not load very well either. ','?'

'id: 58684 ',' I could sit on this app all day   it  s so good, it  s a problem. ','?'

'id: 58707 ',' There are so many awesome ideas. ','?'
'id: 58707 ',' I am not a crafty person but have made a few things as gifts that came out great, as well as freezer meals before I had my son, and much more. ','?'

'id: 58737 ',' I so need sub categories. ','?'
'id: 58737 ',' \\nSometimes have issues rearranging my boards too. ','?'
'id: 58739 ',' I have never had one issue with it! ','?'
'id: 58755 ',' \\nI only gave it 4 stars because I  d like to rearrange boards easier and have sub boards within a board. ','?'
'id: 58757 ',' The idea is so creative in itself that it makes creativity easier for me! ','?'
'id: 58757 ',' I barely knew how to work it! ','?'
'id: 58757 ',' However, I am starting slowly but surely to get the hang of the update; which is why I believe 4 stars should suffice. ','?'
'id: 58785 ',' Love this app...but why is it almost 2gb? ','?'
'id: 58788 ',' I  m so glad it  s available to the public. ','?'
'id: 58791 ',' Why does this app use so much memory!? ','?'
'id: 58793 ',' Please bring it back!! ','?'
'id: 58801 ',' \\n\\nThat being said, this app is so easy to use and I recommend it heartily. ','?'
'id: 58803 ',' My connection sometimes crashes on my iPad  I wish I had a way to get to the spot where I was. ','?'
'id: 58804 ',' If you already like Pinterest, are curious to find out what it is, or want an easy way to collect ideas online, I recommend the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 58808 ',' Sew and so ,  I thoroughly enjoy looking for sewing and embroidery pins but I find it annoying that it crashes often and I have to get in again and try to find where I was looking before. ','?'
'id: 58816 ',' You have to get the app or else Pinterest will not work on your mobile. ','?'
'id: 58818 ',' Love the app but you need an easier way to scroll through pins you have "liked" and maybe a way to easily move your likes to a board instead of having to pin. ','?'
'id: 58826 ',' My only complaint is that I would like to have a way to pin items from a website using my IPhone. ','?'
'id: 58828 ',' Don  t even need to explain why it is so great. ','?'
'id: 58832 ',' Whenever I need inspiration or plan a party this site is my GO TO! ','?'
'id: 58834 ',' Love the app overall but I have I unfollowed users numerous times and yet they are never removed from my list and I still see posts from the ones that HAVE finally been removed. ','?'
'id: 58836 ',' I had to put one star so I could rate the worthless APP, but it should be ZERO stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 58843 ',' When I need a laugh I just browse the humor section. ','?'
'id: 58858 ',' Also I would like to have the ability to make a collage in a bulletin board format with ease. ','?'
'id: 58858 ',' I don  t like the scroll feature how you have to go down a list I would like it to be more dynamic. ','?'
'id: 58868 ',' Can use it for many ideas, recipes, remedies etc. ','?'
'id: 58876 ',' And I want to clarify that I have no issues when "re pinning" things. ','?'
'id: 58876 ',' My difficulty only comes from adding pins that are not already on Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 58881 ',' My only complaint of the app is the memory issues. ','?'
'id: 58881 ',' No other popular app has this problem. ','?'
'id: 58881 ',' The developers really need to make the app  s memory work more efficiently. ','?'
'id: 58883 ',' Just don  t like that if you have too many pins in one category, you can  t see the rest of them unless you delete some. ','?'
'id: 58886 ',' Great app for fitness, clothing, house, cooking, &amp; wedding ideas and learning just about how to do anything! ','?'
'id: 58892 ',' I love Pinterest on how easy it is to find ideas and share them, but would like to see the "like" bottom come back from the tile screen. ','?'
'id: 58892 ',' Please fix this back. ','?'
'id: 58893 ',' The problem I have is as I was enjoying my travel I searched one thing and another popped up. ','?'
'id: 58893 ',' It would be nice to keep this clean. ','?'
'id: 58893 ',' Please don  t ruin this for others!!! ','?'
'id: 58896 ',' I love my pinterest and i get lots of cool ideas but it crashes alot. ','?'
'id: 58897 ',' \\nBut now I can  t do it, I didn  t getting \\nhow to do it, how to Pin my favorite \\nthings. ','?'
'id: 58901 ',' But i have to delete it because it uses WAY too much space on my ipod. ','?'
'id: 58901 ',' Please fix this so i can download it again. ','?'
'id: 58910 ',' I just think that there should be more categories available! ','?'
'id: 58910 ',' My other problem is that somehow I got a warning saying I pinned a inappropriate pin! ','?'
'id: 58927 ',' If I wouldn  t have this problem, the app would have gotten 5 stars but for now a 3 is generous enough. ','?'
'id: 58935 ',' But for some reason the app will crash after i pin some items after a while or if I move previous pins to a new board. ','?'
'id: 58941 ',' It  s quite addicting but it crashes after about 20 min for me. ','?'
'id: 58941 ',' I don  t know if everyone else has this problem too. ','?'
'id: 58949 ',' This is an amazing site, but the app requires lots of memory, so you have to keep deleting and reinstalling. ','?'
'id: 58949 ',' It also crashes much too frequently for me. ','?'
'id: 58955 ',' Keeps crashing, but it  s wonderful, otherwise! ','?'
'id: 58957 ',' I can  t stop pinning. ','?'
'id: 58972 ',' This app is awesome and all, but it crashes A TON!!!!! ','?'
'id: 58972 ',' Can you please fix the crashing and bring the like and pin button back?!! ','?'
'id: 58979 ',' The one thing I would like for it to change is that on the computer on pinterest you can see how many pins each one of your boards has but you can  t see that on the phones or iPods but other than that I love it!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 58986 ',' Love this app but I hate that you can  t do everything on the app that you can do on the website. ','?'
'id: 58989 ',' It wasn  t broke, why did you feel the need to "fix it"? ','?'
'id: 58995 ',' Hate that sometimes when you want more info on an item, that the site is no longer available. ','?'
'id: 59005 ',' why the heck does it use so much memory though?!? ','?'
'id: 59006 ',' Love Pinterest but that app crashes about every 10 15 minutes and that drives me nuts :( , ','?'
'id: 59012 ',' I love this app I love that you can look at all the different category  s  you want ! ','?'
'id: 59013 ',' I didn  t expect the mobile app to be great since I enjoy large screen foe viewing massing amount of pins at a time. ','?'
'id: 59015 ',' Occasional crashes but I  m so grateful for Pinterest!!! ','?'
'id: 59016 ',' I love it its my go to app when I need some tips in fashion, hair, makeup, and more , ','?'
'id: 59018 ',' Please add the like and repin buttons back!! ','?'
'id: 59023 ',' But why did you change it, so now you have to click on the photo and wait for it to load the. ','?'
'id: 59023 ',' I miss just scrolling thought and pining or liking to read it later. ','?'
'id: 59024 ',' Everyone needs a Pinterest break for rejuvenation. ','?'
'id: 59026 ',' All you have to do is press and hold the photo a couple seconds to pin. ','?'
'id: 59026 ',' \\n\\nHowever, now the alphabet is missing from the right side of the list of folders on the mobile app. ','?'
'id: 59028 ',' Love it use it for ideas on how to do my hair and nails for dances and parties. ','?'
'id: 59036 ',' I LOVE Pinterest and it works great most of the time but it crashes at some point practically every time I  m on it! ','?'
'id: 59061 ',' I try to scroll down and the page disappears and there is no way to get back to where I was...but other than that I like it, many options do do DIY crafts or to look for a new fashion! ','?'
'id: 59063 ',' If you look on the Internet, you can find instructions on how to make a bookmark so that you can pin stuff on your iPod and iPad. ','?'
'id: 59065 ',' Wish I could see others profiles tho, no to creep just wanted to see what peeps are about. ','?'
'id: 59068 ',' They continually enhance &amp; update the site &amp; app with new, intuitive features. ','?'
'id: 59071 ',' I like the content but I haven  t figured out how to use the site very well. ','?'
'id: 59071 ',' It needs to be easier to pin. ','?'
'id: 59073 ',' \\nThe only bad thing is you can never look quickly!!! ','?'
'id: 59092 ',' While I love Pinterest, my one and only complaint is that this app CONSTANTLY crashes! ','?'
'id: 59092 ',' Please fix the crashing!!!! ','?'
'id: 59094 ',' Please fix that. ','?'
'id: 59102 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 59103 ',' \\n\\nNothing takes more of my time on my phone (not clear if that  s a good thing or a bad thing) , ','?'
'id: 59115 ',' I didn  t know what it was and just thought it was another technology time waster but it really has some wonderful info on it. ','?'
'id: 59117 ',' Love that you can just press and hold to pin, but please put the like button back, so I can instantly like something without having to open picture. ','?'
'id: 59123 ',' I tried to clear my cache and it literally froze my phone up twice because it was so much information and I never realized I needed to be emptying it all the time. ','?'
'id: 59123 ',' Fix this, please! ','?'
'id: 59127 ',' My sister recommended this app and I have used it ever since. ','?'
'id: 59144 ',' I just wish the app wasn  t so strange consuming. ','?'
'id: 59155 ',' Amazing but should have a warning for how addictive it is! ','?'
'id: 59171 ',' As if I needed another way to be addicted to Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 59172 ',' Definitely addicting...don  t like the change where you have to click the pic in order to pin though. ','?'
'id: 59182 ',' My only complaint is I wish it would let me know if I already pinned the same thing so I won  t repin it again! ','?'
'id: 59183 ',' I can find all the tutorials that I need  ^_^ , ','?'
'id: 59187 ',' The crashing is annoying, but I  m sure the engineers are working on it. ','?'
'id: 59193 ',' Would love a "done it" pin added in a future update. ','?'
'id: 59198 ',' It crashes every 7 8 minutes on my iPhone and it gets really annoying especially if you are in the middle of pinning something. ','?'
'id: 59201 ',' The aforementioned Note 2, in the same location, has no problems. ','?'
'id: 59203 ',' Highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 59204 ',' SUPER hate the new update   there is no longer a pin or like button on the front page, you have to go into the pin to like it. ','?'
'id: 59206 ',' I just love it! ','?'
'id: 59217 ',' I just LOVE it! ','?'
'id: 59221 ',' However, I  d much rather just not have it crash. ','?'
'id: 59235 ',' I just love it and so will you! ','?'
'id: 59237 ',' Learned so many tricks and how to make stuff! ','?'
'id: 59238 ',' If you love Pinterest, I believe you will enjoy using this app everywhere you go. ','?'
'id: 59258 ',' Just beware ~ you can spend hours browsing through Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 59259 ',' I just browse DIY when bored. ','?'
'id: 59260 ',' That way I can still use the other apps on my phone. ','?'
'id: 59277 ',' :) if u need an idea,or something to do u can get on Pinterest and you find great ideas and some fun things to do! ','?'
'id: 59278 ',' I have never had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 59279 ',' Only issue is sometimes you run out of items and have to go back. ','?'
'id: 59281 ',' Also if you can  t get the browser to function properly, it should just be taken out of the app. ','?'
'id: 59282 ',' I wish there was a way of saving a recipe to a file for later call up . ','?'
'id: 59282 ',' If there is currently a way to do this I don  t know it. ','?'
'id: 59286 ',' So much space that my iPad crashed and I had to have it restored at my local Apple store. ','?'
'id: 59286 ',' If you do not go into the Account Settings and clear all the data and pictures everytime you use the app, it hogs up space and will create a serious problem for you later. ','?'
'id: 59296 ',' I like having all my resources at my fingertips, and not stack piling them in multiple file cabinets. ','?'
'id: 59305 ',' I try searching my pins, but it hardly ever finds them, even though the description clearly has the words I am searching for. ','?'
'id: 59308 ',' Just bought our first home and getting a lot of ideas! ','?'
'id: 59313 ',' But, what are the drawbacks you ask? ','?'
'id: 59322 ',' I probably don  t know how to use it properly but I  m entertained for hours. ','?'
'id: 59329 ',' The humor is great because sometimes you just need a good laugh:) , ','?'
'id: 59342 ',' I am finally learning how to cook. ','?'
'id: 59343 ',' TED monster ,  I think everyone should be on pinterest. ','?'
'id: 59347 ',' It  s easy to use and the first place to go when I want info on how to make something. ','?'
'id: 59359 ',' I have contacted Apple &amp; they said it  s a problem with the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 59359 ',' Love Pinterest...just wish I could use it on my I Pad!!! ','?'
'id: 59361 ',' I don  t know why but I just deleted it. ','?'
'id: 59364 ',' I love Pinterest, whenever I come to a long pin, it crashes! ','?'
'id: 59375 ',' Another improvement I would love to see is the option to move pins to a new board of mine without having to repin each thing again like I just found it . ','?'
'id: 59377 ',' I need to start using all my pins!!! ','?'
'id: 59381 ',' Instead you have to actually go into each picture that you have an interest in. ','?'
'id: 59381 ',' Would like to see the ability to pin put back on the first place that you see a pin not when you have to go into the actual pin itself. ','?'
'id: 59396 ',' AmandaS75 ,  On my iPod Touch ( 4th generation) I can not use this current version. ','?'
'id: 59412 ',' I highly recommend Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 59417 ',' I created 5 boards in a matter of a minute! ','?'
'id: 59424 ',' However, when it tells you when you have already pinned something, I wish it would tell you what board you already posted it to!! ','?'
'id: 59429 ',' I  m not sure how to operate the site. ','?'
'id: 59437 ',' Just wish I wouldn  t have to click on the picture to pin or like something. ','?'
'id: 59440 ',' When I  m out and about and need to check a pin, the app is easy to use and access. ','?'
'id: 59441 ',' I just deleted this app because it seems to be an actual browser which never dumps the cache. ','?'
'id: 59443 ',' When you are browsing, you can  t return to where you were. ','?'
'id: 59445 ',' Please fix the like button to what is was before the update, it so much more user friendly when you could like something and didn  t have to download it first. ','?'
'id: 59446 ',' Just check out their pins! ','?'
'id: 59449 ',' I also appreciate the folders that can be "locked" so that only you can see what is pinned in there instead of the whole Pinterest community. ','?'
'id: 59449 ',' Another cool feature is if you find someone with similar interests, you can follow whatever folders (boards) they have made. ','?'
'id: 59449 ',' I still like Diigo, but now just use that for my students, and I use Pinterest for my personal use. ','?'
'id: 59452 ',' I love this site because I like to see what others are creating. ','?'
'id: 59452 ',' These are shared ideas from others who have completed projects and great ideas on how to make them more efficiently. ','?'
'id: 59463 ',' It just takes more time. ','?'
'id: 59465 ',' now u have to explain to my trainer why i dont get into the gym ne more! ','?'
'id: 59467 ',' The only complaint I have is that you can hit the like button from the main page. ','?'
'id: 59468 ',' It would be nice to just repin or like without having to open the entire picture. ','?'
'id: 59469 ',' If you don  t have this app yet, you need it if you like to make things or just get ideas. ','?'
'id: 59470 ',' Never have any problems :) , ','?'
'id: 59479 ',' Please don  t ever leave me. ','?'
'id: 59483 ',' Haven  t had any major problems with the Pinterest app. ','?'

'id: 59492 ',' \\nNow I need to do some of the stuff!! ','?'
'id: 59504 ',' I LOVE this app ~ BUT it crashes all the time!! ','?'
'id: 59504 ',' Other then that five stars ~ but please fix the crashing issue!!! ','?'
'id: 59505 ',' Helps me plan stuff. ','?'
'id: 59513 ',' They still need to go back to one column. ','?'
'id: 59529 ',' I  ve had an account with Pinterest for a while now and I had gotten the app too, they  ve done so many new fixes and upgrades since then that I just LOVE IT! ','?'
'id: 59533 ',' A few minor bugs and some crashes but just addicting. ','?'
'id: 59564 ',' Love this app...how did I function without it? ','?'
'id: 59584 ',' People have posted nude and crude pictures so just report those! ','?'
'id: 59591 ',' It should have a back button to not loose your place but that is all. ','?'
'id: 59593 ',' Please change it back! ','?'
'id: 59595 ',' Also every time I try to post a comment it blocks me and tells me I  m spam. ','?'
'id: 59607 ',' A great way to keep track of nearly everything you ever want to do, plan to do, hope to do, or dream of someday doing. ','?'
'id: 59610 ',' \\nI would give it 5 stars if the uploading issues could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 59613 ',' I just wish you could pin something from safari , ','?'
'id: 59622 ',' I would  ve given it a five star, except I can barely use it! ','?'
'id: 59622 ',' It crashes so much sometimes I can  t repin something, because it crashes. ','?'
'id: 59622 ',' Fix it, please! ','?'
'id: 59623 ',' The new version crashes approximately every 30 minutes. ','?'
'id: 59626 ',' No like button and it crashes every few minutes. ','?'
'id: 59635 ',' However, I continue to have issues with freezing when accessing the source sites for pins, and frequently get thrown off. ','?'
'id: 59646 ',' I can do research on places I plan to travel to and be inspired by beauty and wisdom. ','?'
'id: 59655 ',' You can create collages from your pins. ','?'
'id: 59686 ',' I hate that this last update doesnt have the like button in the main page...its neat that u can pin it by just clicking the picture but we need the like button again. ','?'
'id: 59691 ',' easy to get on and just look up something really quickly. ','?'
'id: 59691 ',' great for when my sister is using my laptop, I can use the app to get ideas for outfits, hair, decorating, just about anything! ','?'
'id: 59695 ',' I can  t stop looking! ','?'
'id: 59699 ',' It has made some upgrades and they may be a little challenging getting use to. ','?'
'id: 59704 ',' Love the app, but only giving 4 stars as I cannot figure out how to   tag   friends in a pin as the upgrade promised. ','?'
'id: 59705 ',' Now I can support my Pinterest addiction anywhere I go, but its kind of hard to navigate the pictures , ','?'
'id: 59707 ',' Why can  t every app be this easy? ','?'
'id: 59710 ',' I miss when the boards were in alphabetical order; and you did not have to click on the pin to pin it, the pin button was on the front of the pin. ','?'
'id: 59714 ',' I would suggest getting. ','?'
'id: 59717 ',' I love Pinterest in general, and the app is ok, but it would be cool to slide through pins like you can pictures on Facebook. ','?'
'id: 59722 ',' I do like how it shows the board you pinned to after so you can double check having selected the correct one. ','?'
'id: 59722 ',' Oh thanks for adding the  you already pinned this  cant tell you how many repeat pins I had! ','?'
'id: 59724 ',' Love to pin   just dislike how on the iPad it kicks me out every time I use it when I  m browsing the Internet thru Pinterest   annoying please fix! ','?'
'id: 59725 ',' Pinterest has added spice to my life and made me a hit with all my friends!!! ','?'
'id: 59729 ',' I like the Send feature but you need to go back to the way the app was before when you didn  t have to click on the picture to Pin or Like something. ','?'
'id: 59736 ',' I love how you can get recipes,fashion,crafts,DIY projects,and you can just have fun! ','?'
'id: 59736 ',' Everyone should use pinterest in my opinion. ','?'
'id: 59737 ',' Not liking the fact you have to open it to Pin, but not all the time. ','?'
'id: 59767 ',' I like the app, but it would be better if you could do certain things on the app that at this point you cannot. ','?'
'id: 59767 ',' You have to go online to do that. ','?'
'id: 59773 ',' Please go back, I am having more problems with it than ever. ','?'
'id: 59777 ',' We need now video mode , ','?'
'id: 59785 ',' I like the update besides the fact you can  t like the thumbnail version of it. ','?'
'id: 59789 ',' I just love it! ','?'
'id: 59799 ',' Then it will crash the whole app. ','?'
'id: 59802 ',' I only wish you could post to Instagram as well. ','?'
'id: 59810 ',' The iPad app crashes routinely. ','?'
'id: 59817 ',' Love the app except you can  t flip the phone sideways and view on the widescreen. ','?'

'id: 59866 ',' I love seeing other people  s great ideas and being able to store their  s and mine in one easily accessible location. ','?'
'id: 59880 ',' I love this site, I like the app except the latest update makes it so you have to click on a pic to like it which I  m not fond of. ','?'
'id: 59881 ',' Why do you need half my phone resources? ','?'
'id: 59888 ',' I would rather look at Pintrest on my computer than my iPhone or iPad as it crashes every time I want to see something up close. ','?'

'id: 59920 ',' So I was not able to use the app at all, hence the 1 star rating. ','?'
'id: 59920 ',' Please provide the option to log in using someone else  s FB account. ','?'
'id: 59921 ',' Sometimes I need to have multiple pins open as I  m cooking and I can  t do that with this app. ','?'
'id: 59926 ',' Please bring back the like button!! ','?'
'id: 59929 ',' Please fix the update. ','?'
'id: 59930 ',' I no longer need to pour through dozens of magazines; if something is worth sharing, odds are, it  s on pinterest! ','?'
'id: 59936 ',' It was perfect until they updated it. ','?'
'id: 59957 ',' \\n\\nWith regards to Pinterest in general, I have a problem with the limited number of secret boards. ','?'
'id: 59960 ',' Pinterest is so much fun and there are so many ideas! ','?'
'id: 59960 ',' I never have a problem navigating the site and can go back to review all pins to my boards with no problem! ','?'
'id: 59962 ',' \\n\\nI really ENJOY using Pinterest from my iPad and look forward to adding the pens, perusing the new pins of others, and generally being entertained by the discoveries. ','?'
'id: 59963 ',' First off, it crashes when I  m in the middle of scrolling for no apparent reason. ','?'
'id: 59965 ',' I feel like it  s hit or miss as to if the app will actually work. ','?'
'id: 59970 ',' I wish there was a way to avoid unwanted ads and areas of non interest. ','?'
'id: 59984 ',' Continues to crash after 20 min of the app being open. ','?'
'id: 59985 ',' I can use this for everything! ','?'
'id: 59995 ',' Alana Cielo ,  I like the app a lot it  s just the only problem is that since I updated it I have to hit the picture to pin it instead of just going through the feed and hitting the pin button , ','?'
'id: 60002 ',' Does Pintrest make sure the links go to the picture or is there a chance of clicking a page that leads to a virus or spyware? ','?'
'id: 60013 ',' But, I did give it a four because now you have to click the picture to like it and the sensitivity of the right swipe, you lose your place and have to reload your category. ','?'
'id: 60022 ',' Great time waster and awesome ideas on how to kill time in the future. ','?'
'id: 60025 ',' I love Pinterest but the new update to the app made an extra step to like something :(. ','?'
'id: 60027 ',' Having read previous reviews, I have to say I would like to have a "like" button, however I don  t so I can only review on my experience with pinterest as it is set up now. ','?'
'id: 60028 ',' \\n\\nUpdate 7/7/13\\nI haven  t had nearly the same freezing issues as I did in the past. ','?'
'id: 60030 ',' It  s annoying and a waste of time not to be able to be shown how it works. ','?'
'id: 60034 ',' Yes it  s annoying that you have to click on the picture to say you like it but it takes 1 second. ','?'
'id: 60034 ',' I love this app and yes I  m addicted but I still haven  t figured out how to post my own pins. ','?'
'id: 60059 ',' The best part is that you can pinned in your board, but you give credit to the person that you had copied from. ','?'
'id: 60063 ',' I would like to see 3 improvements:\\n1) Be able to arrange my boards alphabetically or otherwise. ','?'
'id: 60067 ',' When the app is working its great , I wish there was a better way to know who follows you back , ','?'
'id: 60068 ',' I haven  t had any problems with it! ','?'
'id: 60075 ',' You have to click each item before you can like or pin it which slows down the process and makes it difficult to browse. ','?'
'id: 60077 ',' It  s quite frustrating, please consider fixing. ','?'
'id: 60079 ',' Instead of wasting hundreds of dollars on name brand clothing and items, people around the world can show you how to get something similar for so much cheaper! ','?'
'id: 60082 ',' I recommend pininterest when you r bored or want a quick laugh. ','?'
'id: 60099 ',' The app is fairly easy to learn how to pin things and put things in separate categories for easy access later. ','?'
'id: 60121 ',' The iPad app is okay but it is a pain to try and figure out how to pin something from the web. ','?'
'id: 60121 ',' It  s okay to look but not very functional if you find something online that you want to save. ','?'
'id: 60127 ',' Please fix this problem. ','?'
'id: 60131 ',' I have an iPhone 5   not sure if this is the issue. ','?'
'id: 60134 ',' People who are complaining about it are jerks who think that something should work their way instead of the way it actually works. ','?'
'id: 60136 ',' However I agree with others, put some previous features back please. ','?'
'id: 60142 ',' I  m wondering why it is taking so long to fix the email function. ','?'
'id: 60142 ',' Otherwise, I like it   don  t need the Like button as many other users are looking to use. ','?'
'id: 60145 ',' The program crashes on my iPad constantly. ','?'
'id: 60149 ',' I just LOVE all of the ideas. ','?'
'id: 60159 ',' THE ONLY THING I wish is that there is some way we can share certain pins with particular people (like if I  m following someone I know and find something they would like or if i need their opinion on it, I would like to BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT PIN). ','?'
'id: 60162 ',' I love pinterest but the app itself is slow and crashes. ','?'
'id: 60170 ',' I have had no problems with the app. ','?'
'id: 60178 ',' However, the app version crashes so often I get discouraged. ','?'
'id: 60178 ',' I have tried turning everything else off, rebooting and still it crashes. ','?'
'id: 60196 ',' Also you can  t just like it, you have to click on the pin and then you can like it. ','?'
'id: 60199 ',' I used to just use Pinterest for humor pins but I am stuck on a strict no starch diet and Pinterest (specifically via this app) has been the best resource anywhere for great recipes. ','?'
'id: 60205 ',' But there are a few things that could use a little tweaking. ','?'
'id: 60211 ',' Awesome for pulling up pins on the go to get recipes and ingredients or supplies needed to make the pins I have posted. ','?'
'id: 60212 ',' I love this app, it especially comes in handy when I need ideas for parties, baby showers, holidays etc:)!! ','?'
'id: 60217 ',' \\nTo anyone posting photos of the human body, especially female ones, it  s very likely that you  ll be emailed saying your pin was removed because if nudity. ','?'
'id: 60217 ',' \\nSo if you plan to post a lot of female models in erotic poses just be prepared to have it removed. ','?'
'id: 60225 ',' Everyone should have a Pinterest account! ','?'
'id: 60229 ',' Wish I could have an app that is just a pin and connects with my pins , ','?'
'id: 60241 ',' I like Pinterest, but I just downloaded the app and it doesn  t keep me logged in and every time I try to log back in, it says there  s on error on their end and that it can  t log me in. ','?'
'id: 60246 ',' Whenever I need a cool recipe or fun craft, this is the first place to go! ','?'
'id: 60248 ',' Works great, easy to use, though some features not intuitive, such as how to pin something from an outside source. ','?'
'id: 60250 ',' Please give users the option to update or not. ','?'
'id: 60251 ',' Just installed this, I  m really enjoying this. ','?'
'id: 60265 ',' Ever since these last few updates where we had to hold on the picture to repin it, the app crashes faster!! ','?'
'id: 60271 ',' I know others who have had this same issue. ','?'
'id: 60279 ',' Is there a support group for pinterest addiction? ','?'
'id: 60293 ',' Nice app but it repeatedly crashes on me. ','?'
'id: 60296 ',' So I looked it up and other people have the same problem. ','?'
'id: 60301 ',' If you are out and need to look up something for a project it is right there. ','?'
'id: 60302 ',' It never fails to amaze me and give me fun and exciting new ideas and recipes. ','?'
'id: 60306 ',' I have been unable to find out how to post to Pintrest from my iPad. ','?'
'id: 60309 ',' I hate it when I pin an item only to find it  s just a picture...no instructions (how to make or where to buy). ','?'
'id: 60321 ',' Please put the pin and like buttons on the Pin. ','?'
'id: 60329 ',' People are rating it low since you can  t just click like on a picture while you  re scrolling through, but rather have to take the time to click on the picture to like it. ','?'
'id: 60333 ',' Shouldn  t have updated..it crashes and saving pictures to my camera roll takes FOREVER, then I can  t get it to stop saving and I  m stuck doing nothing. ','?'
'id: 60333 ',' Don  t recommend this version. ','?'
'id: 60335 ',' Passed a pinterest idea off as mine ;) \\n\\nThat  s what it  s there for right? ','?'
'id: 60341 ',' It crashes quite often, but that may be my iPad  s fault more than the program  s.  Endlessly diverting. ','?'
'id: 60348 ',' I have suggested this seemingly simple concept to pintrest before but they seem to have no desire to implement this and make it more user friendly. ','?'
'id: 60354 ',' I love Pinterest  anyone who knows me could tell you that! ','?'
'id: 60354 ',' So please fix the crashing! ','?'
'id: 60368 ',' Everything that  s anything is here! ','?'
'id: 60371 ',' Nice app to post pics! ','?'
'id: 60373 ',' Would suggest more frequent rotation of projects. ','?'
'id: 60376 ',' There are so many ideas to find for so many different needs. ','?'
'id: 60377 ',' This will be my first year teaching and Pinterest has provided me with so many classroom ideas! ','?'
'id: 60384 ',' It does everything you need it to. ','?'
'id: 60398 ',' \\n2) You are unable to access the Pintrest site itself from within the app. ','?'
'id: 60398 ',' Why is this a problem? ','?'
'id: 60400 ',' Please do a better job getting spammers off your site. ','?'
'id: 60400 ',' Please block these users and make your site useful again! ','?'
'id: 60406 ',' Why didn  t I jump on board this craze earlier? ','?'
'id: 60407 ',' Goddess1957 ,  I love to sit back and look for ideas but it crashes so often it drives me bonkers. ','?'
'id: 60438 ',' I did find that seeing the page with all the pins of the people you follow was missing, but that could also be my own ineptitude. ','?'
'id: 60448 ',' The only problem is, and maybe this is a larger Pinterest problem, one of my boards became a "Halloween" board instead of my "Album Cover Artwork" and has populated my board with tons of pins that I didn  t pin. ','?'
'id: 60453 ',' Great ideas and stuff, only downside is missing the like button &amp; there os not enough time in the day. ','?'
'id: 60466 ',' I love Pinterest but it crashes every five minutes or so. ','?'
'id: 60466 ',' Great app, but tends to crash. ','?'
'id: 60472 ',' Pretty good app, but it crashes sometimes and loses what I was reading. ','?'
'id: 60472 ',' Also, I found it hard to first understand how to work the app. ','?'
'id: 60476 ',' I love Pinterest and I think the way the app is designed is very nice but I  d sure like it if it would freeze and crash all the time! ','?'
'id: 60478 ',' I wish you could still just pin and like without having to click on the pic. ','?'
'id: 60483 ',' But, I think the like button should be with the pin on the home page. ','?'
'id: 60483 ',' It  s annoying now that u have to click on that pin and then you can hit the like button. ','?'
'id: 60491 ',' I am here almost everyday. ','?'
'id: 60491 ',' Please keep up the good work. ','?'
'id: 60495 ',' Either way it  s not a deal breaker because the app really is great. ','?'
'id: 60496 ',' Unicorns should have a wind sock on their horns so they would the be useful. ','?'
'id: 60498 ',' What is the point of using the app if it crashes and then I have to scroll down through all of the pins to get back to where I was before. ','?'
'id: 60498 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 60499 ',' I am beginning to think that I am going to have to set an alarm or start a support group or my housework may never get done! ','?'
'id: 60499 ',' I definitely recommend the app, it makes viewing pinterest much better on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 60501 ',' I love that you can just press and hold a pin to repin it. ','?'
'id: 60505 ',' Pinterest provides me with so many new, fresh ideas for cooking, crafts, and home decor! ','?'
'id: 60505 ',' How did I live without it!?!? ','?'
'id: 60506 ',' Gives helpful ideas; but half of the things can  t purchase what I like! ','?'
'id: 60509 ',' I don  t really care the "Like" button is missing like a lot of users seem to. ','?'
'id: 60509 ',' \\n\\nAnyway, there IS now a reminder when it seems you  re about to pin something you  ve already pinned. ','?'
'id: 60517 ',' \\n\\nOtherwise I agree with other posts that the like/pin buttons need to be available without clicking on the picture if you  re in a hurry and just want to save it for later. ','?'
'id: 60517 ',' \\n\\nAlso in my ipad app i am not able to change my cover photo for my boards. ','?'
'id: 60524 ',' They need to work on their cache settings. ','?'
'id: 60524 ',' When we deleted the app, it crashed her phone and we had to restore factory settings. ','?'
'id: 60529 ',' The only thing I don  t care for is for the ones who post pictures that you have to click on twelve different things to try and find the recipe, and then the recipe doesn  t exist! ','?'
'id: 60531 ',' I love this app, it  s so easy to find the greatest ideas for anything you can think of!! ','?'
'id: 60535 ',' \\n\\nI love the latest version, but would like to see the like button brought back! ','?'
'id: 60549 ',' Anytime I need and idea an inspiration or just a visual pick me up this is the first place I turn. ','?'
'id: 60551 ',' Sometimes the links crash on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 60571 ',' Only problem I have is sometimes it randomly crashes, right in the middle of something! ','?'
'id: 60572 ',' I have made some food and done some DIY from Pintrest:) I  d recommend to anyone:) , ','?'
'id: 60575 ',' Love it but please bring back the like button . ','?'
'id: 60582 ',' Only problem is if you start scrolling late at night, you probably won  t get very much sleep lol oh well, that  s on you! ','?'
'id: 60583 ',' Random provocative photo with a caption that says "You can look like this with this 30 day diet". ','?'
'id: 60590 ',' But why does it have to use so much of my memory? ','?'
'id: 60596 ',' Just because I view images doesn  t mean they need to be in my cache taking up my memory. ','?'
'id: 60611 ',' Blown away by the talent and ideas that are out there! ','?'
'id: 60612 ',' What did I do before Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 60625 ',' But I hate that it doesn  t go straight to the app when I try to pin from my web browser. ','?'
'id: 60625 ',' Also it would be nice if you could use a custom picture for pins that don  t have a pinnable image. ','?'
'id: 60630 ',' Thank God for whoever made this app!!! ','?'
'id: 60632 ',' Everything you can think of is here! ','?'
'id: 60634 ',' The app frequently crashes (so annoying) but it  s worth it. ','?'
'id: 60638 ',' Love Pinterest, what did I do before it? ','?'
'id: 60641 ',' But I  m not happy with it always crashing, I have even cleaned up my iPad and it still crashes. ','?'
'id: 60641 ',' It  s not just once in a while the app will crash, it  s almost every couple of minutes. ','?'
'id: 60641 ',' I will be on the app for 20 to 30 minutes and the app crashed at least 10 to 15 times. ','?'
'id: 60643 ',' This new way is too many steps. ','?'
'id: 60652 ',' there are no problems. ','?'
'id: 60668 ',' Wish it would go back to just clicking repin instead of clicking the picture then repinning , ','?'
'id: 60670 ',' \\nIn addition, rarely does the app open to the same set of pins as it showed when it crashed. ','?'
'id: 60670 ',' \\nThese two issues really need to be fixed as they undermine all of the excellent attributes. ','?'
'id: 60673 ',' Positive: new updates with search feature are pretty helpful to search your own pins or all pins\\n\\nNegative: it crashes time to time. ','?'

'id: 60712 ',' There are so many good food, home remedies, DIY, Travel ideas and many more. ','?'
'id: 60718 ',' Also  you need a way for links to pins being automatically included! ','?'
'id: 60719 ',' The ease of moving around could be improved, it can be awkward to get from place to place. ','?'
'id: 60719 ',' My biggest problem is the crashing. ','?'
'id: 60719 ',' I bet it crashed on me 6 or 7 times in a brief time the last time I was on which is very discouraging since I really do like the app. ','?'
'id: 60720 ',' But please please bring back the like button!! ','?'
'id: 60724 ',' Since the upgrade, it continuously crashes on both my iPad &amp; iPhone. ','?'

'id: 60790 ',' Now you just have to hold a picture to pin but on the iPad you have to browse through all your boards. ','?'

'id: 60796 ',' I need you in my life pinterest! ','?'

'id: 61197 ',' The like button is still available as well as the pin button without clicking on the picture. ','?'
'id: 61199 ',' I hate when ever I  m reading something or looking at something cool it exited me out of the app and I lose what I was reading please fix immediately I love the app it  s awesome do I would like to fix that so I can go on it with our being exited out , ','?'
'id: 61212 ',' I love Pinterest but after i pin about 30 consecutive things or even if i pin on thing and then pin another it crashes. ','?'
'id: 61212 ',' Please create a  new update!! ','?'
'id: 61214 ',' What ever makes you happing or you are interested in is here in Pintrest ! ','?'
'id: 61239 ',' But overall I recommend this to everyone. ','?'
'id: 61244 ',' I actually like that you have to enlarge to like. ','?'
'id: 61246 ',' This app crashes once I select a picture. ','?'
'id: 61260 ',' So easy and I have all of the pins when I need them. ','?'
'id: 61265 ',' I like that you can send pins to friends that they might like. ','?'
'id: 61286 ',' The way your app builds up a cache might seem convenient, but it  s poor coding for an iOS app. ','?'
'id: 61286 ',' Once fixed, I will update my review. ','?'
'id: 61289 ',' It allows you to decide what  photos you like and most likely will be astounded at all the photographs that you can select that will be at your beaconed call . ','?'
'id: 61294 ',' They seem to have fixed the crashing issue that this app used to have! ','?'
'id: 61297 ',' I love the concept but it is constantly crashing. ','?'
'id: 61297 ',' I have an iPad 1 but I  m not sure that  s the problem. ','?'
'id: 61312 ',' However, I have a couple issues that are keeping me from giving it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 61312 ',' Another other issue is how long it takes to load a pin (although that may not be the app  s issue   I  m not completely sure). ','?'
'id: 61318 ',' I can  t count how many times a day I use this app! ','?'
'id: 61322 ',' I love this app, whenever you need any ideas this app is the place to go. ','?'
'id: 61334 ',' I wish you could keep loading the category pages like when I  ve scrolled through women  s fashion, I would like to keep scrolling. ','?'
'id: 61334 ',' Also you need a dorm category and a disney category. ','?'
'id: 61342 ',' How about you? ','?'
'id: 61352 ',' The feature of liking items could be spruced up to be more convenient. ','?'
'id: 61352 ',' Otherwise it  s great and I think there should be a cake category. ','?'
'id: 61353 ',' The problem is that I get stacked and have to delete and reload the app over and over ... , ','?'
'id: 61354 ',' As many have complaints of have to wait for the pics to load before they can like or pin. ','?'
'id: 61358 ',' The only thing I don  t like is that the other site that gives you more information ask you to down load their apps and before you know it you storage space is out. ','?'
'id: 61366 ',' I  ve found so many delicious recipes and decor ideas that are practical and affordable!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 61372 ',' What I can  t stand is when the app just shuts down when I  m in the middle of pinning something, then I can  t find it again. ','?'
'id: 61374 ',' And this new way of picking a board is a mess. ','?'
'id: 61375 ',' Haven  t had any problem with app functionality, but Pinterest really should have a way to report spam. ','?'
'id: 61390 ',' I do have occasional issues with it crashing, which is why I didn  t give it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 61412 ',' Love this app, but crashes periodically on my iPad . ','?'
'id: 61418 ',' Thankfully it rarely happens, but it would be nice to be able to report that kind of thing. ','?'
'id: 61423 ',' It is my go to when I need inspiration for a meal, decorating, or school activity. ','?'
'id: 61426 ',' No need to say more. ','?'
'id: 61433 ',' wish there was an easier way to like photos. ','?'
'id: 61445 ',' But the app can use some improvement. ','?'
'id: 61454 ',' I just love it!!!! ','?'
'id: 61458 ',' But after the new update I cannot use the app as swiftly as I had before. ','?'
'id: 61458 ',' Before the update you could like something with ONE tap of your finger, but now you have to click the picture, like the post, hit the back button and waste time in doing so. ','?'
'id: 61458 ',' I did in fact try to report the problem to Pinterest, but that too I found far more tedious than I thought it would be, claiming that I needed a snapshot from my camera roll to accompany my complaint. ','?'
'id: 61462 ',' I go here whenever I need an idea for literally anything! ','?'
'id: 61462 ',' I agree with the others that the like button needs to come back on the main screen without having to click on the picture! ','?'
'id: 61464 ',' There is also an issue occasionally in sizing and finding your way around that to repin without backing out controlling the size and then repin. ','?'
'id: 61468 ',' I just wish you could scroll through images to the side so we can maximize the view before clicking on it. ','?'
'id: 61474 ',' Search the web and never forget where you saw the cute picture,recipe or outfit, just pin it to your board! ','?'
'id: 61477 ',' I just love it. ','?'
'id: 61481 ',' I absolutely recommend this app to everyone I know! ','?'
'id: 61482 ',' Don  t have any problems with this app except that I had to go online to follow one of my friends because it doesn  t give you the option to search for your friends by name. ','?'
'id: 61492 ',' Sometimes crashes. ','?'
'id: 61511 ',' I like it but it crashes all the time on my iPad!!!! ','?'
'id: 61512 ',' Pinterest, why are you always crashing? ','?'
'id: 61512 ',' I love the idea of   easier pinning   but I wish you could make it to where it was easier to like stuff. ','?'
'id: 61520 ',' I like the update but sometimes it takes a while when I try to pin something because you have to hold it. ','?'
'id: 61522 ',' I agree with one of the comments about Pinterest crashing on iPhone. ','?'
'id: 61522 ',' I wish I could have more than 3 private boards! ','?'
'id: 61524 ',' I  ve gotten many great ideas and inspirations from the pins available and look forward to many more! ','?'
'id: 61526 ',' I just love this place. ','?'
'id: 61564 ',' You can  t look at just one thing, you HAVE to keep scrolling down to find the coolest, most interesting things. ','?'
'id: 61568 ',' Now it crashes all the time especially since I can  t pin from main board anymore. ','?'
'id: 61571 ',' You have to actually go into the pin itself to like it. ','?'
'id: 61574 ',' Super fun, addicting app, but sometimes it will randomly crash and you have to go back and find the board you were on, etc. ','?'
'id: 61581 ',' it however, after about 30 45 minutes it crashes in the middle of an article and I  d have to reopen the app. ','?'
'id: 61587 ',' I like that you can find anything from a recipe to what goes with real colored pants! ','?'
'id: 61598 ',' It takes too long to repin by holding it down or clicking on it please bring back these buttons for WAY FASTER pinning!!!! ','?'
'id: 61602 ',' It provides so many ideas for every area of life. ','?'
'id: 61602 ',' Once you start you can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 61607 ',' I love pintrest when it works right I tells me no pins available alot n I can  t view Who is following me. ','?'
'id: 61614 ',' Only suggestion is to fix sort of boards , ','?'
'id: 61617 ',' The search should be linked to the origin not the comments people make. ','?'
'id: 61618 ',' This app makes me not be able to finish my homework. ','?'
'id: 61623 ',' Now that  s gone, and you have to scroll through the whole thing, which is much less convenient and very annoying. ','?'
'id: 61624 ',' Please, please don  t let that happen anymore! ','?'
'id: 61625 ',' On the mobile app, why is it possible to add a comment to a pin that you upload but not to a pin  you  re  repinning from someone else  s board? ','?'
'id: 61625 ',' \\nFor such a basic functionality to be missing is weird. ','?'
'id: 61625 ',' \\n\\n     \\n\\nI  m not completely sure how to use Pinterest, but it  s intriguing and beautiful and refreshingly innovative. ','?'
'id: 61625 ',' \\n\\nI agree with another commentor that it is disappointing not to be able to pin using the app. ','?'
'id: 61625 ',' Would be nice to have that capability. ','?'
'id: 61627 ',' Sometimes it  s just a pic without detail as to what it is or how to do it. ','?'
'id: 61629 ',' I find so many great ideas I just love this site. ','?'
'id: 61630 ',' I need the like button back!!! ','?'
'id: 61643 ',' Please bring back the like and pin buttons so that you don  t have to click on the item first!! ','?'
'id: 61650 ',' But I to wish the like button was still readily available. ','?'
'id: 61655 ',' Would be nice to be able to move pins round easily. ','?'
'id: 61660 ',' Updates have really made this a great app , ','?'
'id: 61663 ',' The like button needs to return or have a double tap option like Instagram. ','?'
'id: 61663 ',' That is a problem that needs to be addressed! ','?'
'id: 61666 ',' Almost any category of pictures is available. ','?'
'id: 61668 ',' Only had minor issues with the app but nothing that made it hard to use or inconvenienced me! ','?'
'id: 61672 ',' I had no idea I could have so much fun without the clutter. ','?'
'id: 61679 ',' It  s lively and fun but will you PLEASE FIX THE CRASHES! ','?'
'id: 61679 ',' Other than that its a fantastic use of my time; and I recommend it to anyone who likes pictures! ','?'
'id: 61681 ',' Love the app, but it could use some improvements like pinning without having to open it, crashing, etc. , ','?'
'id: 61682 ',' I recommend this lovely app to anyone with any hobbies/interests. ','?'
'id: 61687 ',' Everything and Anything you would need or like to know. ','?'
'id: 61692 ',' How did I live without it? ','?'
'id: 61705 ',' So easy to keep track of ideas, latest update not the best too many steps and no like button, apps always seem to change things to make it easier to use, but screw everything up in the process, if it ain  t broke don  t fix it! ','?'
'id: 61706 ',' When I  m pinning, I  ve noticed the only time it says that I  ve already pinned it, is if the caption stayed the same. ','?'
'id: 61706 ',' I  ve noticed several duplicate pins just with different captions. ','?'
'id: 61709 ',' What happened to the infinite scroll? ','?'
'id: 61710 ',' \\n\\nTo help all of my fellow Pintersters on iPads/iPhones:\\nTo "quick pin" just hold your finger on the the pin of your choice and it will allow you to pin as before! ','?'
'id: 61712 ',' With this latest update you can  t hit like when just scrolling down...bring back the like button please! ','?'
'id: 61720 ',' Everything you can think of for ideas is here on Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 61722 ',' It crashes sometimes. ','?'
'id: 61723 ',' I like the new suggestions at the bottom if the pin, but losing the letters that made filing into a board quick is a major loss! ','?'
'id: 61727 ',' It is amazing what you will find and learn on this app. ','?'
'id: 61731 ',' Still wish there was an easy way to pin from sites not already included in Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 61734 ',' Hi could you please help me. ','?'
'id: 61746 ',' Seems like there should be something that could be done to fix it! ','?'
'id: 61752 ',' Although this app crashes quite a bit, I love Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 61752 ',' I recommend this app! ','?'
'id: 61772 ',' Becky Lynn ,  Why does this app take up so much space? ','?'
'id: 61775 ',' Haven  t had it crash in a while , ','?'
'id: 61777 ',' Please return the Like button to the main page. ','?'
'id: 61785 ',' Crashes sometimes but all apps can have issues at times! ','?'
'id: 61803 ',' the only thing I suggest is to give back the like button so you can like something when scrolling through feed. ','?'
'id: 61805 ',' It  s not "pinning faster" as they say you have to hold on the picture for to long and wait for your board list to come up. ','?'
'id: 61805 ',' That or you have to click on the item and do it manually. ','?'
'id: 61806 ',' They changed it so you only need to press and hold the image to pin it. ','?'
'id: 61806 ',' It  s actually better now because you never have to leave the main pin board to pin something. ','?'
'id: 61811 ',' But, you have to click on the image to like it; which is the only fault for me. ','?'
'id: 61813 ',' I recommend this site to everyone I know! ','?'
'id: 61817 ',' This is one of the best designed mobile apps available. ','?'
'id: 61820 ',' My life would hold no purpose and boredom would overtake my soul. ','?'
'id: 61823 ',' Please fix these bugs!! ','?'
'id: 61832 ',' Pictures of all over the world , do you want to see what Nepal looks like ? ','?'
'id: 61832 ',' Want a tip on how to plant rhubarb, beans, or a flower bulb. ','?'
'id: 61836 ',' Just love it! ','?'
'id: 61839 ',' Haven  t had any issues with the new update and like the fact I can press and hold over a pic to pin it, makes pinning faster lol , ','?'
'id: 61855 ',' I do think the program has need of much improvement and needs to be more user friendly as mentioned by other users. ','?'
'id: 61858 ',' s. OK, so this is what I have problems with: 1) when viewing Pinterest on my desktop, the pictures overlap each other making it difficult to view what I have recently pinned as differentiate my boards, 2) I would like to be able to pin more than one item at a time, I think the pin option should be like your email as far as being able to select a number of pins at one time and then placing it within your desired board, 3) I would also like to be able to   like   several   pics at one time without it having load the pic, like it &amp; then close it, very inefficient IMO, &amp; lastly this may apply to the iPad only however, when I am viewing and pinning pics through my iPad the program randomly closes out &amp; then I have to reopen and scroll down to the section that I was previously viewing which is a hassle at times because often I end up scrolling through several screens before I can get back to the section I was viewing. ','?'
'id: 61858 ',' Please, please, please Pinterest resolve these issues and I will be a loyal pinner for life &amp; I will update my rating to ? ','?'
'id: 61861 ',' People are saying you have to click on the picture to pin something BUT you don  t have to (: just hold your thumb down on the picture to pin something! ','?'
'id: 61867 ',' The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is that it still crashes occasionally, but it has gotten a lot better. ','?'
'id: 61869 ',' I love pinterest and this app is great, I like you can edit your boards, but it shuts off at random intervals. ','?'
'id: 61873 ',' I  m so glad they updated so you can now search thru your own pins, but it would be nice to have the like button back. ','?'
'id: 61874 ',' I wish there was a way to hide any pin you don  t want to see and if there is a way I wish it was more clear how to do it (I have tried everything!) ','?'
'id: 61884 ',' Bring back 1 click feature so you don  t have to click on a pic 2x in order to like it and its annoying after you click on an item and hit PIN it brings up all the extra images within the pinned item that needs to go. ','?'
'id: 61884 ',' Still a BIG fan but the update needs an update. ','?'
'id: 61885 ',' For those of us managing multiple accounts, we need the ability to toggle between accounts on the mobile app. ','?'
'id: 61894 ',' I enjoy Pinterest, there is so many ideas that you can use in your everyday life! ','?'
'id: 61899 ',' It used to be that you could repin or like a pin without having to click on it and go to its page. ','?'
'id: 61899 ',' In this "updated version" you have to go into the page of the pin to repin or like and it is annoying enough that I have stopped using the app and started using the desktop version. ','?'
'id: 61900 ',' Now that I know how to use it, I am finding out how wonderful it really is! ','?'
'id: 61900 ',' Please bring back the Pin button. ','?'
'id: 61901 ',' Now, you have to scroll through ALL your boards if you want to get to the last board. ','?'
'id: 61907 ',' Only problem is when it freezes or shuts down , ','?'
'id: 61911 ',' I use this app just about every day in search if new ideas and recipes. ','?'
'id: 61919 ',' I don  t know if there is a way of not but on my smart phone wished I could have my boards listed alphabetically or could do a quick search. ','?'
'id: 61939 ',' Is there a 10 step program for pinaholics? ','?'
'id: 61942 ',' My only complaint is that on the computer or on the phone you can  t rearrange your pins on a board without having to move it to a new board and move it back again. ','?'
'id: 61942 ',' They need to develop a way to drag pins wherever you want on a board, then it will merit 5 stars in my opinion. ','?'
'id: 61964 ',' My favorite everyone needs to get on here , ','?'
'id: 61968 ',' I don  t know how I ever made it without Pinterest   I have boxes of magazines and papers filled with ideas  this makes it so simple. ','?'
'id: 61969 ',' \\n\\nThe only drawback that I have seen thus far is being able to easily Customize my Home page and to create links from pictures that I upload myself. ','?'
'id: 61969 ',' \\n\\nThe only question remains is can they figure out how to expand their platform to be more social communication Friendly   for that I say "Give me a call" I didn  t give Disney the Holy Grail kernel of my platform and no one has figured it out yet   \\n\\nMeanwhile in the words of the movie Field Of Dreams   I  m building it so they will come. ','?'
'id: 61975 ',' There are so many DIY ideas on here! ','?'
'id: 61978 ',' No matter how many times I update this app, it crashes, while I  m trying to pin something. ','?'
'id: 61978 ',' So it crashes, and is then lost which is crazy annoying! ','?'
'id: 61978 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 61984 ',' Love having Pinterest whenever I need it. ','?'
'id: 61989 ',' You have to click open the pin to repin it with updated version. ','?'
'id: 61993 ',' I love cooking, but can  t print out on my iPad mini. ','?'
'id: 61993 ',' So, when I come across a recipe I like, I just pin it to my Pinterest album labeled "Recipes". ','?'
'id: 61995 ',' I just wish the pictures load faster and had better information attached. ','?'

'id: 62387 ',' This would be a 5 star rating if there was a more convenient way to search pins that I  ve pinned before. ','?'
'id: 62388 ',' This has got to be the best app ever, who needs cookbooks anymore when you have an unlimited amount of recipes to choose from!!! ','?'
'id: 62397 ',' The first issue is how much data it caches. ','?'
'id: 62397 ',' Upon deleting the app, I then have to restart my phone which can take up to forty five minutes as it clears all the data (this is the only time I ever have this issue with my phone). ','?'
'id: 62397 ',' Now you have to either press and hold the item to pin it, which doesn  t always work but is always slow, or open the pin to like it. ','?'
'id: 62401 ',' I made some mistakes myself when I first started to use it, but that was my fault. ','?'
'id: 62403 ',' but have gotten soooo many great ideas :) I think this updated version is even better now that you can share and comment on other people  s posts! ','?'
'id: 62408 ',' Please fix or I  m quitin on Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 62411 ',' I have no problems with the usability of the app, but right now it is the largest app on my iPad at over a gig of memory. ','?'
'id: 62411 ',' I think this caching problem is something important to be addressed (soon!) ','?'
'id: 62414 ',' Please put it back the way it was! ','?'
'id: 62422 ',' It  s great for when u are planning events or projects. ','?'
'id: 62422 ',' Or if u need new recipe ideas or just like looking at cool pics. ','?'
'id: 62424 ',' Pinterest is my go to place for everything and anything I need or need to know. ','?'
'id: 62424 ',' Thank you for being what every girl needs! ','?'
'id: 62440 ',' I love the fact that you can pin something by just holding your finger on it for a second instead of having to make the pic bigger : ) keep up the good work I love this version!! ','?'
'id: 62442 ',' There is so many different ideas on it and they all inspire me as well as I find most of my clothing stores and hair styles from here. ','?'
'id: 62442 ',' It always updates the sites and ideas and its overall an awesome app. ','?'
'id: 62444 ',' They need to bring the like feature. ','?'
'id: 62451 ',' Leaving you to have to tap the screens back button to original page. ','?'
'id: 62455 ',' Primarily in the hiding of the navigation buttons unless I explicitly drag them down from the top   why can  t I just swipe to go back? ','?'
'id: 62461 ',' I think the way you double tap to repin in the droid app is a little nicer. ','?'
'id: 62467 ',' My only request is that you could view pins in landscape view or zoom in because sometimes it can be a little small and hard to read. ','?'
'id: 62469 ',' I would stay on for days if I could but somebody  s needs to feed the children LOL can  t get enough!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 62471 ',' I can  t stop looking at everything on Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 62489 ',' \\nMy only complaint/suggestion is that when you click on a picture you can  t turn the phone sideways to see it bigger. ','?'
'id: 62495 ',' But it tends to crash. ','?'
'id: 62495 ',' I  m reading something hilarious but I haven  t had time to pin  and then it crashes!!! ','?'
'id: 62497 ',' I  m addicted to the concept of this ap but don  t particularly like that you can only see pins from those you are following. ','?'
'id: 62497 ',' The ap crashes constantly on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 62500 ',' I don  t want to have to look through nail art when I  m looking for hair ideas and vice versa. ','?'
'id: 62502 ',' However, the app has crashed a few times, and always before I  ve pinned, and then I can  t find the thing again. ','?'
'id: 62527 ',' I DO NOT like the new update where you have to press and hold the picture to repin. ','?'
'id: 62528 ',' Really good, but still needs some tweaking. ','?'
'id: 62535 ',' It can tell a story. ','?'
'id: 62539 ',' You guys really need to make that easier for us pinners. ','?'
'id: 62540 ',' I also love how you can follow someone else who has similar taste OR check out something new! ','?'
'id: 62541 ',' Thank you for finally adding the feature that tells me I already pinned something! ','?'
'id: 62544 ',' So nice to have when you have to sit and wait somewhere. ','?'
'id: 62556 ',' I planned my daughters birthday through this along with my wedding! ','?'
'id: 62565 ',' I personally haven  t tried any of the recipes on here yet but I can  t wait to!! ','?'
'id: 62568 ',' My only problem is that my app always crashes now and it  s about every 10 min. ','?'
'id: 62570 ',' Almost all of my favorite recipes are from Pinterest...never had a problem with it! ','?'
'id: 62573 ',' It has everything I need from recipes to fun homemade Christmas gifts! ','?'
'id: 62576 ',' I didn  t expect this app to be so useful and inspirational. ','?'
'id: 62592 ',' I just got this app and now I  m addicted! ','?'
'id: 62597 ',' I can not tell you how much more easy it is to pick up a project and start working on it or trying a new recipe without having to lug my computer around. ','?'
'id: 62600 ',' \\nI wish there was a way to avoid the dead end sights like flkr or tumblr. ','?'
'id: 62603 ',' I love pinterest, its my life saver, when i need a recipe, workout, fashion ideas i just click and take a look at my boards. ','?'
'id: 62606 ',' I recommend it. ','?'
'id: 62614 ',' Pinterest has added some new features lately that make it even more fabulous. ','?'
'id: 62622 ',' It has helped me decorate my apartment, feed my guests  with a huge menu, and it  s even helped me plan my future wedding. ','?'
'id: 62622 ',' I love Pinterest and i recommend it to everyone I know! ','?'
'id: 62628 ',' I really love this app and I  m addicted to Pinterest bow but whenever I select a picture to look at it closer the app crashes and its impossible to fond the picture again without scrolling through a ton of pictures I have already seen PLEASE FIX but thanks for the awesome app! ','?'
'id: 62631 ',' Truly the most perfect way to share things you are passionate about. ','?'
'id: 62631 ',' The only thing I don  t like is that with the new version you can  t like or repin immediately, you have to make it bigger , ','?'
'id: 62632 ',' I deeply dislike having to open a picture to like it The old way was better!!!! ','?'
'id: 62633 ',' Only problem is it can be really slow once in a while. ','?'
'id: 62634 ',' The last update requires to many clicks and reduces speed in finding what I like and want to save! ','?'
'id: 62645 ',' With the update you just keep your finger on the pic for like a second and you can pin it that easily. ','?'
'id: 62646 ',' The ideas, recipes, and interests are amazing. ','?'
'id: 62648 ',' I do however like that you can now search your own pins, that  s awesome. ','?'
'id: 62658 ',' It crashes all the time, it often says no pins are available &amp; most of all I miss being able to pin &amp; like something without having to click on it &amp; leave the page I was on. ','?'
'id: 62658 ',' It shouldn  t be a problem going back but very often it is because the app will crash right in the middle of a pin &amp; when I reopen it, I  m not able to start where I left off. ','?'
'id: 62672 ',' Just like Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 62682 ',' one of my favorite apps, but don  t like that you have to open the pictures now  to pin them. ','?'
'id: 62692 ',' Haven  t seen anything else so informative since google when I want to learn how to do a task or project. ','?'
'id: 62695 ',' When introduced to pinterest I knew I was going to have a problem. ','?'
'id: 62728 ',' Highly recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 62737 ',' But on my iPad this app often crashes , ','?'
'id: 62740 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 62754 ',' The mobile app crashes a lot for me, but love everything else! ','?'
'id: 62759 ',' Awesome app but very frustrating when you search and search for something and the app crashes before you finish reading the article. ','?'
'id: 62769 ',' Just add a like and pin button to the pins while your scrolling!! ','?'
'id: 62773 ',' You need to bring back the like button and include a zoom on the pictures!! ','?'
'id: 62781 ',' I dont care about the LIKE feature but pinning in general is easy now that all you have to do is hold down the image! ','?'
'id: 62787 ',' Okay, i love pinterest but the only problem now is that i have to click the picture just to repin or like the picture. ','?'
'id: 62793 ',' I wish it would ask you, "Are you sure you want to pin to _ _ _ _ _ board?" ','?'
'id: 62802 ',' I also liked having my boards in alphabetical order! ','?'
'id: 62810 ',' Used to love it but what happened to the easy click pin it and like buttons?? ','?'
'id: 62813 ',' Please bring back the option to pin or like without having to click on the item. ','?'
'id: 62816 ',' Worst customer service EVER in the event you have a problem! ','?'
'id: 62818 ',' Just download it. ','?'
'id: 62820 ',' The only thing I have to complain is every update seems to make it less and less user friendly and I have to re learn how to use the app; other than that I  m happy ? ','?'
'id: 62824 ',' Thanks rating again: Thanks for adding the scroll to top still love me some Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 62830 ',' I hate that it crashes so often! ','?'
'id: 62845 ',' I didn  t like the new version at first...where was the "pin it" button on the big list? ','?'
'id: 62850 ',' Never knew you could get so many ideas from a pic. ','?'
'id: 62854 ',' I was still able to log in on my computer, and I even made a new pinterest with a separate email and it still will not work. ','?'
'id: 62857 ',' It has a couple bugs, but overall I love it. ','?'
'id: 62857 ',' I love you Pinterest, but you really need to have a lighter application to be useable. ','?'
'id: 62872 ',' About every 10 minutes, it crashes and I have to reboot it. ','?'
'id: 62874 ',' All you have to do is log in.....you  ll understand. ','?'
'id: 62887 ',' I have no complaints with this one and it has never crashed. ','?'
'id: 62892 ',' I just love it; it  s so addicting. ','?'
'id: 62893 ',' I do not like that on the recent update you have to click on the picture first before you can like something. ','?'
'id: 62901 ',' I absolutely love this app, but please put the like and pin buttons back. ','?'
'id: 62904 ',' Not too many problems with it crashing. ','?'
'id: 62912 ',' I really like Pinterest in general, but I  d like to be able to like or repin something by just touching the button. ','?'
'id: 62921 ',' There are so many ideas on here! ','?'
'id: 62930 ',' It  s a great way to save ideas without the clutter of paper everywhere that you  ll never find when you need it! ','?'
'id: 62937 ',' I really like having it on my phone but it just takes up too much space. ','?'
'id: 62947 ',' Its like having every magazine, every educational video and everything else you could think of all in one place. ','?'
'id: 62952 ',' It is like making many visual boards that don  t clutter up my office space, yet are always available at the palm of my hand! ','?'
'id: 62953 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 62958 ',' While Pinterest as a whole is pretty nifty (despite the fact that this review template opened up with a 5 star, love it kind of review already populated), what I need is easier transitions between pinning, liking and browsing. ','?'
'id: 62958 ',' \\n\\nMy other concern is regarding the "like" button (the heart from the browsing page)   it is now missing. ','?'
'id: 62958 ',' This needs to come back, because liking something should take less time than pinning something. ','?'
'id: 62963 ',' Like everyone else, I agree this version needs some fixing! ','?'
'id: 62968 ',' And I can  t tweet a pin from my phone at all :( go back to the last version. ','?'
'id: 62973 ',' Please fix this problem I want my app back!! ','?'
'id: 62979 ',' But every single time I go on, after about 3 minutes it crashes. ','?'
'id: 62979 ',' It doesn  t seem like anybody else has this problem, but I would love if you would fix it. ','?'
'id: 62984 ',' Wish the ability to fetch more pins was available. ','?'
'id: 62985 ',' You can use it on the go!! ','?'
'id: 63001 ',' Love to start my day with viewing new meals to make, some cool pictures and the fun tech gadgets I can add to my tech gadget collection. ','?'
'id: 63003 ',' It  s a fun sight to have,to go see what  s newly posted and pin it yourself. ','?'
'id: 63009 ',' Does what it  s supposed to, just wish I could work with my\\nProfile easier. ','?'
'id: 63010 ',' This is one of those apps that works a bit differently than the site but is great in its own ways, you can tell they really thought about how best to adapt it to the little iPhone screen in a visually attractive and functional way. ','?'
'id: 63021 ',' Just hold down the picture and the pin option screen shows up. ','?'
'id: 63038 ',' I can  t get enough of it now that the updates are here. ','?'
'id: 63040 ',' I also like the prayers that circulate....adding them to my prayer board helps me feel blessed to pray for people I may or may not even\\nknow! ','?'
'id: 63046 ',' I just love Pinterest!!! ','?'
'id: 63057 ',' How did I make it BP (before Pinterest)? ','?'
'id: 63072 ',' Wish that bug could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 63075 ',' \\nLove love every page of that is available. ','?'
'id: 63076 ',' Ever since the update, about every 3rd or 4th time (sometimes even sooner) Pinterest as a whole closes automatically and I need to reboot it. ','?'
'id: 63078 ',' I just can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 63087 ',' It  s always crashing but other than that, GREAT. ','?'
'id: 63089 ',' If you think the wedding planning and recipes are boring, Pinterest has plenty more to offer, such as two boards dedicated to humor and geek culture. ','?'
'id: 63093 ',' I use this app every day and font have any problems! ','?'
'id: 63098 ',' Works just like the website. ','?'
'id: 63112 ',' Does about what I  d expect! ','?'
'id: 63113 ',' I also love to post stuff and I also like going around and looking at what others posted. ','?'
'id: 63120 ',' I keep having the app fail and I am getting tried of it ! ','?'
'id: 63128 ',' Still learning how to pin and share stuff on FB , ','?'
'id: 63135 ',' Please fix this glitch. ','?'
'id: 63137 ',' It  s really nice to have and get ideas, but it needs to go back to its original version, but besides that, I really enjoy it :) , ','?'
'id: 63138 ',' Love seeing what others post. ','?'
'id: 63145 ',' Great app however there are toooo many crashes! ','?'
'id: 63157 ',' It would be nice if Pinners could be spared offensive pics while glancing thru recipes and nature pics! ','?'
'id: 63162 ',' I love the fact I can find pictures and create boards of my interest. ','?'
'id: 63167 ',' It  s a good thing that my house does not get the best of cell service or I  d never get anything done. ','?'
'id: 63182 ',' How could you not love this place? ','?'
'id: 63185 ',' Pinterest is awesome I love it on my I pad mini the only thing bad is that I can  t change my board covers unless I am on my computer , ','?'
'id: 63204 ',' We planned my parents entire 50th Ann bash from diff city  s and had a AWSOME celebration. ','?'
'id: 63204 ',' I can  t just look at something, I get memorized for hours and hours!!! ','?'
'id: 63212 ',' I find everything I need on Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 63219 ',' The only down side is that if ur in there for awhile juar pinning away it just happens to just like crash or something it then takes u out of Pinterest and back to ur apps erasing where u left off its the only reason for a 4 star rating. ','?'
'id: 63221 ',' Have had no problems, and it  s super easy to use. ','?'
'id: 63226 ',' I like the app and have never had an issue with it! ','?'
'id: 63253 ',' Love the app but you still have to click on pics and then hit pin or like...please bring back the shortcuts so we don  t have to waste time clicking and loading the pin. ','?'
'id: 63257 ',' I think that there is a large misconception that needs to be addressed for many users b/c it  s effecting ur ratings. ','?'
'id: 63257 ',' It looks as if many people had the same issue I did until I was notified by a dialog box that you only have to PRESS &amp; HOLD TO REPIN ITEMS! ','?'
'id: 63262 ',' Haven  t had any problems with this app!!! ','?'
'id: 63268 ',' As for the app, it crashes often when you click in a pin. ','?'
'id: 63284 ',' Please bring back the pin button on the feed! ','?'
'id: 63291 ',' Every time I open the app it runs for a few minutes, and then it crashes. ','?'
'id: 63291 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 63303 ',' It has so many uses and I highly recommend getting it. ','?'
'id: 63323 ',' Great app and all submissions by others have helped me creating new ideas for parties. ','?'
'id: 63326 ',' With the new update, it seems to crash every time you try to look at your re pins or when you try to look at other pins. ','?'
'id: 63329 ',' I can use it for all aspects of my life. ','?'
'id: 63331 ',' I spend lots of time on it just scrolling and pinning things straight from my feed. ','?'
'id: 63342 ',' Is there a detox program for addictions to Pintrest? ','?'
'id: 63342 ',' Have enjoyed the pins I  ve physically pursued, and plan to try the thousands I hold in reserve for that "someday"! ','?'
'id: 63343 ',' Please fix this!! ','?'
'id: 63351 ',' I haven  t had any problems :) , ','?'
'id: 63364 ',' You don  t have to click on every pin before you repin like everyone is saying. ','?'
'id: 63364 ',' I just love Pinterest!! ','?'
'id: 63366 ',' You could like and repin stuff by just tapping it. ','?'
'id: 63370 ',' Sometimes it  s a little slow and it crashes and I have to restart, but that doesn  t happen very often. ','?'
'id: 63373 ',' When I first started using Pinterest I didn  t know how to use, and after I figured it out   BAM! ','?'
'id: 63374 ',' Also, app crashes periodically. ','?'
'id: 63377 ',' \\nImprove the glitches, please , ','?'
'id: 63385 ',' I just love Pinterest period. ','?'
'id: 63389 ',' I would really like to see a like button on the images though. ','?'
'id: 63391 ',' Some links don  t work and it is frustrating and they should have more videos. ','?'
'id: 63397 ',' Don  t know how I would function without it :) all of the other reviewers have said they can  t pin without clicking on the picture. ','?'
'id: 63397 ',' Well if they would  ve watched the instructions when you first opened it after the update you would know you just hold the picture for a second and then you pick a board. ','?'
'id: 63412 ',' Content is generally very good, but the system crashes often. ','?'
'id: 63418 ',' Still trying to figure out how to move around but for the most part, a great place to share information &amp; get information on just about every topic. ','?'
'id: 63424 ',' Also, it  d be nice if I could use my ap. ','?'
'id: 63453 ',' I have not had many issues with the app and it  s very addictive. ','?'
'id: 63459 ',' So please fix it. ','?'
'id: 63463 ',' I have had no problem with it so far!! ','?'
'id: 63468 ',' I love you Pinterest you  re oh so pinteresting! ','?'
'id: 63472 ',' Super addicting but I don  t like that you can  t email pins anymore from your personal account , ','?'
'id: 63474 ',' Gave it only 4 stars because it crashes on my iPad ALL the time. ','?'
'id: 63484 ',' Actually that might be a good thing or I  d never get anything else done. ','?'
'id: 63487 ',' It should also have the ability to add a photo of your version of the same project so you could compare side by side (linked somehow on your own boards). ','?'
'id: 63487 ',' \\n\\nBiggest problem is that it constantly closes itself. ','?'
'id: 63493 ',' It  s very convenient, until it crashes, which it does whenever I  m reading something really good. ','?'
'id: 63496 ',' So many ideas it is overwhelming! ','?'
'id: 63505 ',' Please change it!!! ','?'
'id: 63508 ',' It  s easy to use and doesn  t fail too often. ','?'
'id: 63514 ',' I can  t stop pinning stuff! ','?'
'id: 63517 ',' But, it just takes up TOO much space on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 63517 ',' Just keep it on the Internet. ','?'
'id: 63517 ',' Why would they build such an functionless app with so many subscribers? ','?'
'id: 63517 ',' You need to rethink your iPad app and make it much more useable. ','?'
'id: 63524 ',' The only thing I would suggest in an update would be the ability to like a pin by double tapping it or something if the sort. ','?'
'id: 63532 ',' It would be better if you could swipe through the pins while exploring instead of having to tap the "x" every time . ','?'
'id: 63538 ',' Pinterest is awesome and I love having an IPad APP for it but it crashes after about 15 minutes for me every time. ','?'
'id: 63541 ',' The ideas are endless!! ','?'
'id: 63549 ',' Just love the inspiration of these pins, and of those doing so much creative work. ','?'
'id: 63558 ',' Pins keep getting posted to folders I have NOT created! ','?'
'id: 63561 ',' Never crashes , ','?'
'id: 63566 ',' If you need inspiration or ideas for anything, this is app you need. ','?'
'id: 63570 ',' With the new update you don  t have to click on the item and then pin it manually, if you just put your finger on a picture you want to pin and hold it down , a box will come up so you can pin it. ','?'
'id: 63575 ',' I need Pinterest rehab. ','?'
'id: 63584 ',' This is a great app, I love how it fetches pins in my favorite categories, it  s clear pictures and ease of going to the different sites by just tapping the pictures. ','?'
'id: 63584 ',' But and it  s a big but, it crashes constantly. ','?'
'id: 63585 ',' I really enjoy this app and I  ve never has any problems with any of the updates. ','?'
'id: 63590 ',' I only want it to have more variety of pics on each slide. ','?'
'id: 63593 ',' There is a button in settings for clearing the image cache, but it never works. ','?'
'id: 63598 ',' Can  t praise Pinterest enough!! ','?'
'id: 63600 ',' Everything you need to know its on here , ','?'
'id: 63604 ',' Also crashes when I  ve been browsing and pulling up pins for a while. ','?'
'id: 63627 ',' I have read other reviews complaining about the latest update but I haven  t had any issues. ','?'
'id: 63628 ',' but I hate that you have to click on the image to like or pin it. ','?'
'id: 63637 ',' A shortcut pin would allow me to zip through more ideas and get them pinned before the app bombs! ','?'
'id: 63638 ',' You have to be careful with this app because its so amazing!! ','?'
'id: 63652 ',' If I could only have one app, this would be it. ','?'
'id: 63673 ',' This app also crashes a lot especially when I  ve been on it for a while or when I "pin" or "like" multiple things. ','?'
'id: 63675 ',' Highly recommend repinning and sharing. ','?'
'id: 63677 ',' Need ideas or a clue how to do something hobby wise? ','?'
'id: 63682 ',' I also think the garden ideas are very helpful too!! ','?'
'id: 63683 ',' I don  t like that when looking at others pins you have to actually go into the link to like it. ','?'
'id: 63686 ',' I also hate that you can  t print anymore!! ','?'
'id: 63688 ',' This app needs a faster way to delete its cache or just delete it when the app is closed completely. ','?'
'id: 63690 ',' That you can pin w/out going into each and every pin, that it pulls the three most recent boards so you don  t have to scroll through the whole list each time, and that it tells you if you  ve already pinned an item previously are all great improvements! ','?'
'id: 63691 ',' You are supposed to be able to search your pins, however I have tried twice and not come up with what I wanted when it clearly should have. ','?'
'id: 63700 ',' Now you have to open the pin and like it. ','?'
'id: 63704 ',' I  ve found out how to do so much and so many ideas for future things! ','?'
'id: 63706 ',' This app is a great thing to use to find different ideas. ','?'
'id: 63709 ',' It is really amazing you have to try it , ','?'
'id: 63732 ',' kdtmanila21 ,  It  s such a great app I use it for about everything but I think it needs an update seems like it takes forever to load pics other than that it  s great just pls update the pics so they download faster pls! ','?'
'id: 63736 ',' This app crashes every time I try to use it. ','?'
'id: 63739 ',' Please fix this !! ','?'
'id: 63750 ',' \\n\\nReally wish you could look at an infinite amount of pins in a certain category, but this app always stops the pins after a few pages. ','?'
'id: 63751 ',' I would like to see the return of the pin and the like buttons w/o having to click on the picture. ','?'
'id: 63758 ',' This it my favorite web page...so many great ideas..however I wish this app could be corrected. ','?'
'id: 63766 ',' Makes me laugh when I need a laugh and lifts my spirits w good quotes. ','?'
'id: 63766 ',' Get it if you don  t already have it and don  t forget to upgrade if you already do! ','?'
'id: 63770 ',' It  s amazing how much time you can spend on this site. ','?'
'id: 63779 ',' The app also crashes fairly often. ','?'
'id: 63780 ',' I LOVEEEEE the new update but seriously need to fix the crashing problem! ','?'
'id: 63780 ',' Soooo annoying being on the app and having it crash all the time. ','?'
'id: 63796 ',' I  m in love with Pinterest and now it  s at my fingertips at any time I choose (unless I  m in bad cell reception of course and then I just count the minutes of my slow death.) ','?'
'id: 63797 ',' I just hate how it crashes sometimes. ','?'

'id: 64301 ',' I really like that you can go on the Internet with this app now and pin other things that weren  t originally on the first pin. ','?'
'id: 64301 ',' And re pinning specific categories is so much easier now because the app remembers your most recent boards that you just pinned something in; I personally appreciate that because I tend to jump back and forth from board to board. ','?'
'id: 64308 ',' And as far as I  ve seen in the few weeks of familiarizing myself w/ it, &amp; discovering some of the ins &amp; outs, and finding any tricks or the tips that will be useful &amp; time effective,   I just haven  t.\\n\\nI would like to be able to put the pins on my board in certain placement and I am unable to do that.

'id: 64499 ',' There are so many ideas I would not have thought of myself! ','?'
'id: 64506 ',' s ipod ,  I liked it at first but the new update is very inconvenient because now you have to actually click on the post to Like it and sometimes I Like a pin so it will save before the app crashes but now I can  t even do that. ','?'
'id: 64522 ',' I hate how you have to click on it to repin if you don  t want to hold it down! ','?'

'id: 64612 ',' Pinning is MUCH easier now because all you have to do is hole down on the picture icon and select which board you would like to pin it to. ','?'
'id: 64618 ',' And I  m glad they added the feature that let  s you know if you already pinned something before. ','?'

'id: 65262 ',' I have made recipes, crafts and have so much more pinned to do. ','?'
'id: 65267 ',' But in the scope of its benefits that  s a VERY minor issue. ','?'
'id: 65275 ',' But you have to hold it down for a while and it used to auto populate the latest board you  ve pinned to and that was easier than pulling up the last three then having you select it. ','?'

'id: 65436 ',' I have no complaints except that I wish pins could be more easily moved around boards once they  ve been pinned. ','?'
'id: 65438 ',' I like this site a lot, the only thing I would change is how you are able to view some of the pins. ','?'
'id: 65438 ',' I don  t like being redirected to the web address the pin came from, and a lot of times you can  t re pin from there, either. ','?'

'id: 65740 ',' Sometimes I will stay on it for hours at a time. ','?'

'id: 65762 ',' My favorite way to experience Pinterest is the app. ','?'
'id: 65762 ',' I highly recommend it if you like Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 65765 ',' The latest update has made Pinterest much better for mobile devices and doesn  t big out nearly as often as it had in the past. ','?'
'id: 65776 ',' Also sometimes my own pins won  t load and I need to refresh the board and scroll several times to see everything. ','?'
'id: 65778 ',' They should have sub boards so you can organize pins even better , ','?'
'id: 65800 ',' Please allow confirmation before pinning !! ','?'

'id: 65865 ',' Please fix this!! ','?'
'id: 65876 ',' I love that it is readily available to me for whatever reason I need. ','?'
'id: 65876 ',' The ideas I come across are genius and I would never have thought of anything so simple and effective otherwise. ','?'
'id: 65877 ',' I would give it 5 stars, but you have to click the picture to repin/like the pin. ','?'
'id: 65877 ',' Or you have to hold down the picture for a few seconds and waste time. ','?'
'id: 65877 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 65881 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 65881 ',' The only thing is that sometimes is freezes, but that usually resolves itself quickly. ','?'

'id: 65896 ',' Everything and anything worth knowing about could be found with a few key words! ','?'
'id: 65904 ',' It is great to see all the stuff available...but annoying when the links don  t work or go to a site that sells stuff without warning...and I get tired of seeing all the stuff I posted on top. ','?'
'id: 65906 ',' I plan my meals by what i find on Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 65907 ',' I just wish they hadn  t taken away the feature to "like" pins from the main screen. ','?'
'id: 65926 ',' I  m probably missing some step but I  ve read FAQs and can  t figure out why it won  t work on iPad. ','?'
'id: 65930 ',' I would not want anyone to copy all the cool ideas that I copy from strangers, right?! ','?'
'id: 65955 ',' It  s hard to find your boards because they  re all mixed up and not in alphabetical order and you have to click on the pin to even pin it, so pinning takes a lot longer. ','?'
'id: 65957 ',' The app does randomly crash, but no more than  safari. ','?'
'id: 65961 ',' I wish you could search for people using the app , ','?'
'id: 65962 ',' I love everything about Pinterest, I  m a huge fan of the enhancements they have made. ','?'

'id: 66014 ',' New update is different..but everyone complains that you have to open a photo to pin it. ','?'
'id: 66014 ',' Instead of opening it, all you have to do is hold the photo and the pin option is available immediately. ','?'
'id: 66014 ',' This is a small program that turned huge very quickly, overall rating is 5 star, only issue is sometimes it force closes and it loses your spot! ','?'
'id: 66015 ',' I will be on it for hours. ','?'
'id: 66023 ',' I love pintrest except for the lack of the like button now you have to press the image then wait for it to load (which takes a long time sometimes) then press the like button. ','?'
'id: 66052 ',' I and my friends and family use so very many of the ideas and so far have not found any that fail the test. ','?'
'id: 66064 ',' Obviously, I suggest it big time. ','?'
'id: 66068 ',' They need to change it back do you don  t have to click on the pin to like it!!!! ','?'

'id: 66079 ',' Please put the Like and Pin buttons back! ','?'
'id: 66083 ',' I love you Pinterest, but please bring back the like button! ','?'
'id: 66092 ',' It  s still obviously not as good as the online version, but it  s better than nothing when you need a Pintrest fix! ','?'
'id: 66097 ',' \\nBut hate the new update that makes you click to repin. ','?'
'id: 66107 ',' Overall though, if that  s the only problem   I  d say its a pretty good app!! ','?'
'id: 66111 ',' It  s not that big of deal that you have to click on the picture to like it. ','?'
'id: 66116 ',' I mean where else can you plan your dream wedding, house, future child, your next great meal and be able to find a new way to clean ANYTHING?! ','?'
'id: 66121 ',' I just love it!! ','?'
'id: 66124 ',' since the latest update I  ve had issues with this app crashing more and even more annoying, ill be trying to scroll and it  ll automatically refresh and go back to the top. ','?'

'id: 66131 ',' The recipes, home decor, and DIY ideas are fabulous. ','?'

'id: 66139 ',' No more   just forgetting   about a favorite pin, or hoping I would somehow   come back to it   later. ','?'
'id: 66139 ',' This way is faster, more streamlined, and works even when I  m way out in the country or up in the mountains. ','?'
'id: 66150 ',' I love this app but it does have ssome problems that need to be fixed. ','?'
'id: 66154 ',' Sooo inconvenient when you just want to browse generic category like   popular  , please display description again so we know what we are looking at AND the pics are sooo small I have to use glasses just to browse!!! ','?'

'id: 66170 ',' Except for the recent update, I like that you can pin it by holding he picture but not that you have to open it in order to like it , ','?'
'id: 66176 ',' There are so many great ideas on here , ','?'
'id: 66189 ',' I would give it 5 stars if it didn  t frequently crash. ','?'

'id: 66237 ',' I wish there was a way to bookmark the section you were in before when updating the page, it  s almost too much to try and look at, other than that it is so awesome. ','?'
'id: 66239 ',' I love Pinterest...good app to pass the time or waste time, however you want to look at it. ','?'
'id: 66239 ',' Most of the pictures you have to click on to pin. ','?'
'id: 66239 ',' One good thing I did notice is now it updates you on whether or not you pinned something already so that  s helpful. ','?'
'id: 66240 ',' Pinterest really needs to get a handle on their policies. ','?'
'id: 66244 ',' However, do not like my email being blown up every time someone repins my post. ','?'
'id: 66246 ',' Everyone needs to be on Pinterest! ','?'

'id: 66416 ',' With this app, I can pin anything and when I need it, I instantly know where to find it. ','?'
'id: 66417 ',' The only issue is that I am on it too much! ','?'

'id: 66422 ',' The second time I click it it  s 50 images of new stuff the the board I just reviewed. ','?'

'id: 66738 ',' I didn  t notice the like button issue, but it would be nice to have it at the top without having to click through. ','?'
'id: 66742 ',' I like that you can hold down a button and pin so far no problems. ','?'
'id: 66743 ',' I like the new hold and pin feature, but you guys seriously need to make liking a pin easier. ','?'
'id: 66748 ',' I am not too fond of the new update that requires you to click on a Pin before you can like or Repin it. ','?'

'id: 67008 ',' Great way to collect all my Internet clippings, and be social to boot. ','?'
'id: 67013 ',' Please do something or just decline this update bc it  s only more complicated than it was an I thought how it was is #1 Pinterest but I for sure do not like it this way! ','?'
'id: 67017 ',' I just get sucked right into it! ','?'
'id: 67018 ',' You can  t click like from the main screen. ','?'
'id: 67025 ',' This app crashes WAY too much. ','?'

'id: 67091 ',' If ur bored its the prefect way to waste time and it  s fun! ','?'
'id: 67095 ',' The app crashes! ','?'
'id: 67102 ',' So you have to click on the item to review it, just a couple extra seconds...then I  m back to pinning (: , ','?'
'id: 67110 ',' You have to click on the item to repin it. ','?'
'id: 67119 ',' It is a great source of inspiration when I need a new project! ','?'
'id: 67123 ',' I just love this app. ','?'
'id: 67128 ',' Tshoah ,  I love Pinterest but don  t like this update; I NEED the alphabet beside my boards to jump to the board I want to pin to. ','?'
'id: 67137 ',' You have to open and load the pin to like anything and it is very annoying. ','?'
'id: 67138 ',' I just don  t like having to click into the pin to "like" something. ','?'
'id: 67151 ',' Pinterest has made a lot of new updates, such as "already been pinned" feature, press and hold to pin, improved viewing on the pin website, new view of pinning boards. ','?'
'id: 67167 ',' Never crashes, easy and fast to repin, and full of inspiration! ','?'
'id: 67170 ',' Any suggestions? ','?'
'id: 67172 ',' I like how it now reminds you if you have pinned something before ? ','?'
'id: 67178 ',' I hate that you have to click on the pin to repin. ','?'
'id: 67180 ',' I love Pintrest the only hong is with the new update you have to go in the pin to even like it. ','?'
'id: 67203 ',' On Pinterest however, all "pinned" ideas are visible! ','?'
'id: 67209 ',' Everybody told me that I needed to try it out but I never did. ','?'
'id: 67209 ',' Now I signed up and I can  t stop pinning things! ','?'
'id: 67211 ',' I love that I can hold the picture and pin to any board on the mobile version but wish there was a like button available for quick clicks , ','?'
'id: 67218 ',' Please please please fix that! ','?'
'id: 67222 ',' Just like the other reviewers, we love the upgrades, but just put the "Like" button back to where it was. ','?'
'id: 67232 ',' I really love this app, but I hate how it crashes after approximately 10 pins. ','?'
'id: 67238 ',' Please x 100 bring it back. ','?'
'id: 67241 ',' Just tapping the picture and being able to pin it! ','?'
'id: 67245 ',' everyone needs this app! ','?'
'id: 67260 ',' Overall it works well but lately if I try to organize or edit too many pins, the app will crash and I have to reopen it. ','?'
'id: 67264 ',' Very addicting but at least I know how to cook now ! ','?'
'id: 67265 ',' I think peeps don  t realize how to use it cause I think it  s great! ','?'
'id: 67267 ',' I have tried to find out in different ways to \\nget an answer but can  t. I don  t know where to go for help in this situation. ','?'
'id: 67273 ',' You need to bring back the like button and the sidebar alphabet board search. ','?'
'id: 67283 ',' Once you pin, you can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 67284 ',' I like the new search method that they added where I can search my own stuff. ','?'
'id: 67284 ',' I think they should add a way to get through all the pins on the individual board without having to scroll/load forever. ','?'
'id: 67291 ',' I also like how you can now make boards with other people on the ipod/iphone rather than having to get on the computer to do it. ','?'
'id: 67291 ',' The only thing I don  t like about the update is that you can no longer like a pin or repin it while scrolling through the page of pins, you have to click on the pin first; which is SLIGHTLY inconvenient, but all in all Pinterest rules and that  s that. ','?'
'id: 67321 ',' It is the best time killer and you find everything you need plus 10 more ideas! ','?'
'id: 67347 ',' I like some of the feature changes such as the look and icons but the ability to easily share Pins has been removed. ','?'
'id: 67347 ',' You used to be able to send via email or text but now you have to do so within the app (but the recipient has to check Pinterest to get it) or link to your Facebook. ','?'
'id: 67347 ',' I don  t see how to share Pins when someone doesn  t have an account. ','?'
'id: 67356 ',' Sometimes the app crashes but after the last update it seems to be better for now. ','?'
'id: 67356 ',' It would be cool to have some new features like being able to pin from the Internet, there should be a list of people that you may want to follow, etc.. ','?'
'id: 67364 ',' you have to tap the photo to like something, which makes it more time consuming. ','?'
'id: 67366 ',' I would like to know how the pins are organized  sometimes I need to find one of my pins quickly and can  t find it. ','?'
'id: 67377 ',' It  s really fast and ten times better than using the web page which has a million problems! ','?'
'id: 67380 ',' I love all the "How to  s" and great ideas that are on this app. ','?'
'id: 67396 ',' Love it, especially for the fashion inspiration this is just what I need to start a new classy me!!! ','?'
'id: 67398 ',' I just love Pinterest!! ','?'
'id: 67402 ',' Unlike the website when you get to the bottom you have to go back to the main page of categories,and click the one you want to get more pins. ','?'
'id: 67402 ',' Also you can  t leave pins up, because it will go back to the main page if you exit it to check something for a minute then you have to start all over and searching for stuff on the app using the toolbar is a major pain, because you can  t search one category! ','?'
'id: 67406 ',' I easily spend hours on it, those who are complaining that they have to open the pin now to repin just don  t know how to use it, all you have to do is hold down on it for two or three seconds. ','?'
'id: 67430 ',' Occasionally crashes. ','?'
'id: 67433 ',' I recommend it for EVERYONE!!! ','?'
'id: 67434 ',' I haven  t had any problems with it at all. ','?'
'id: 67456 ',' I need to update it, because it is incorrect! ','?'
'id: 67461 ',' The only reason I generously gave two stars is because it has potential to be amazing; it just isn  t there yet. ','?'
'id: 67472 ',' It has everything I need and more. ','?'
'id: 67484 ',' I love pinterest but when i did the latest update the pin and like button went away now i have to click on one item at a time and then pin it so i find myself not getting on near as much because i get irritated with having to do that every single time please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 67488 ',' You didn  t have to click the picture to   like   a pin, now you must go through that annoying process to do so. ','?'
'id: 67488 ',' At least fix or return that like button so it  s easier instead of having us click the picture in order to like it; it  s like you forgot about that when you added the new feature. ','?'
'id: 67489 ',' Please bring them back!! ','?'
'id: 67494 ',' What happened to deleting a "like"? ','?'
'id: 67494 ',' I don  t see how this is done? ','?'
'id: 67495 ',' recently I  ve been very crafty thanks to Pinterest I just love it. ','?'
'id: 67496 ',' You have to click the pin, like/unlike, then go back. ','?'
'id: 67519 ',' why can  t we see   hundreds   like before? ','?'
'id: 67519 ',' Please add this in your next update Pinterest!!!!! ','?'
'id: 67520 ',' What did we do before we had Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 67527 ',' It is a serious problem but I love it! ','?'
'id: 67527 ',' \\n\\nThe only thing is, with the update now you have to click on the picture. ','?'
'id: 67528 ',' Way too many crashes! ','?'
'id: 67531 ',' Please add a quick like button!!! ','?'
'id: 67532 ',' The only thing that I have a problem with and wished it would get changed. ','?'
'id: 67532 ',' I wish you could delete multiple pins. ','?'
'id: 67532 ',' I like cleaning up my boards and it would be so nice to be able to delete more than one pin at a time. ','?'
'id: 67532 ',' Also it would be nice to have more than 3 secret boards. ','?'
'id: 67540 ',' Can  t tell you how much I have learned on Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 67546 ',' I actually came to the reviews to read if others were having problems I thought I over looked it but I guess not! ','?'
'id: 67549 ',' Other than that, I 100% recommend this app! ','?'
'id: 67550 ',' It  s a great app but it  s always crashing when I  m looking at a long pin. ','?'
'id: 67558 ',' Please fix the phone storage issue. ','?'
'id: 67566 ',' New version is a little irritating because when you  re just scrolling, you can  t just pass by &amp;   like   something. ','?'
'id: 67567 ',' I do have to say though I miss the pin it option it  s frustrating having to click on the picture! ','?'
'id: 67569 ',' Works well to find what you need!! ','?'
'id: 67582 ',' Only thing I have issue with is sometimes link does not actually take you to a page with info, just a picture. ','?'
'id: 67586 ',' The only thing I don  t like is you aren  t allowed to post "rated R" things, even on private boards. ','?'
'id: 67588 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 67592 ',' Love the app but I hate that you have to click the picture to pin and therefore start all the way back at the top of the category. ','?'
'id: 67592 ',' I also wish that there was an easier way to manage your pins on your boards, there  s no easy way to delete, move or find pins. ','?'
'id: 67606 ',' It  s super fun, and it has lots of stuff that you can do when your bored. ','?'
'id: 67607 ',' Tutorials are great\\nMeal ideas that will please everyone  s taste. ','?'
'id: 67611 ',' I love how quick this app loads but I hate that you have to select the image to like! ','?'
'id: 67611 ',' Please change it back! ','?'
'id: 67622 ',' This app crashes constantly. ','?'
'id: 67622 ',' In one 30 minute session, it will crash more than 5 times. ','?'
'id: 67623 ',' This app is amazing I love it Add love pinning it from its own web browser I wish you can add in music from iPod library to pin Pin music that you are listening to and hear Sarah camera to pen what TV shows and movies that you are watching on TV , ','?'
'id: 67629 ',' Great app but it crashes often so that  s why I  m not giving it a five star review other than that it awesome. ','?'
'id: 67630 ',' I can  t pin what I want to before the app closes on me! ','?'
'id: 67631 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 67635 ',' \\nThis is the best app to learn how to make ANYTHING!!!!! ','?'
'id: 67642 ',' This makes it incredibly irritating and if you leave your finger on the on a picture for a second too long it automatically assumes you want to Pin it! ','?'
'id: 67642 ',' Oh and it crashes still!!!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 67650 ',' Except the new version you cant just hit the like button, you have to click the picture and then like it. ','?'
'id: 67654 ',' I really recommend it for those who like DIY things or cooking. ','?'
'id: 67660 ',' I love the no adds &amp; ease of usage, but I do not like that I cannot add my own comment when re pinning. ','?'
'id: 67660 ',' Also wish there were more specific searches &amp; why waste one on tattoos ? ','?'
'id: 67663 ',' You have to click on the pin to repin or like, you can  t do it straight from the feed. ','?'
'id: 67665 ',' I would love to give this app five stars because I do love and use it a lot! ','?'
'id: 67665 ',' But it crashes on me quite often the screen going black then sending me to my main phone screen! ','?'
'id: 67665 ',' They need to fix that! ','?'
'id: 67671 ',' The latest update eliminated the ability to "like" a pin without having to actually open the pin major fail! ','?'
'id: 67672 ',' I don  t know how I ever lived without Pinterest!? ','?'
'id: 67674 ',' Hoping the SEARCH bar will be fixed &amp; more options added. ','?'
'id: 67674 ',' The whole idea of   LIKE   is that it is quick &amp; easy. ','?'
'id: 67676 ',' I have made all my sisters in law addicted. ','?'
'id: 67677 ',' I like it and don  t really have an issue with the new update. ','?'
'id: 67679 ',' Pinterest provides a easier way to save reference material. ','?'
'id: 67689 ',' All you have to do to pin something quicker is hold your finger down on the picture. ','?'
'id: 67689 ',' To like it, yes you do have to click on the picture and expand it, but it  s not that bad. ','?'
'id: 67693 ',' I hate that you have to click on the picture to be able to like the picture. ','?'
'id: 67701 ',' Only thing I would change is if when you shared a pin with someone you could add a comment. ','?'
'id: 67705 ',' Please allow horizontal viewing though! ','?'
'id: 67709 ',' I don  t think it  s ever crashed and it  s just all around a great app. ','?'
'id: 67710 ',' That is the only thing that this is missing is being able to pin to other people  s boards . ','?'
'id: 67718 ',' I spend so much time on this site, I love that I can use it on my phone. ','?'
'id: 67725 ',' And I still haven  t figured out how to search my pins. ','?'
'id: 67729 ',' With the new updates, I never have any issues. ','?'
'id: 67732 ',' Pinterest lets me create the life I want. ','?'
'id: 67732 ',' The only warning is give against the wildly accessible Pinterest app is that it  s dangerously addictive, so be careful not to lose your real social life for the beautiful imaginary one it creates for you online. ','?'
'id: 67735 ',' Pinterest is the best thing ever, it  s everything I need in one website ! ','?'
'id: 67736 ',' If you  re on a smart phone (not sure how to do it from a desktop) just touch the picture for a few seconds and let go. ','?'
'id: 67738 ',' I love Pinterest and recommend it to all my friends! ','?'
'id: 67739 ',' It took me a sec to figure out how to edit a description of a repin. ','?'
'id: 67754 ',' Love , but I hate how the app limits how many pics you can see. ','?'
'id: 67755 ',' Great app can  t love without it!!!! ','?'
'id: 67758 ',' Highly recommend this! ','?'
'id: 67759 ',' I wish there was an easier way to reorganize my boards though. ','?'
'id: 67766 ',' Kristaj2015 ,  Some of the other reviewers are saying it  s not as good as it used to be because you actually have to click on the picture to like or repin it. ','?'
'id: 67766 ',' To repin it, all you have to do is hold your thumb down on the small picture, and the repin menu will pop up. ','?'
'id: 67766 ',' As Far as I know, you have to click the small picture and Make it bigger to like it. ','?'
'id: 67771 ',' However, I don  t like having to click on a picture to like it, instead of just liking things more easily as I go like it was before. ','?'
'id: 67781 ',' Can you please bring the like button back to the main feed though?!! ','?'
'id: 67788 ',' Only problem is the unexpected closing. ','?'
'id: 67790 ',' Nor digging the updates, they need to bring the like button back to the front so you don  t have to open the pin. ','?'
'id: 67793 ',' I can  t stop pinteresting! ','?'
'id: 67798 ',' I rarely "like" pics, as I have a board for everything I like, so the new way is fine by me. ','?'
'id: 67798 ',' If I had to come up with a fault, I would say its when you have to scroll through 100s of board titles to pin. ','?'
'id: 67798 ',' But, that  s only a problem if you have 100+ boards, I  d guess!! ','?'
'id: 67805 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 67815 ',' You have to click on the pic to pin it when the update before this one was perfect! ','?'
'id: 67815 ',' \\n(If you don  t understand Pinterest , google it and read how to do it, I did and now I  m hooked) , ','?'
'id: 67828 ',' I love pintrest however the last update made it to where you cannot like something or pin something without actually opening the pin. ','?'
'id: 67829 ',' I also wish Pinterest would allow you to Alphabetize your boards. ','?'
'id: 67829 ',' These are simple fixes so why can  t it be done? ','?'
'id: 67831 ',' I could make this app my full time job if I could get paid for it. ','?'
'id: 67849 ',' I cannot use the app on my phone. ','?'
'id: 67850 ',' Highly recommend it if you  re into learning new things everything day or if you just want to be mystified by the different subjects ppl post. ','?'
'id: 67850 ',' All you have to do is put your interest and the app pulls up things you might be interested in so that you can follow the topic and the poster. ','?'
'id: 67852 ',' My only issue with the mobile app is that it will all of a sudden disappear and send me back to the home screen. ','?'
'id: 67852 ',' Why they would go back? ','?'
'id: 67873 ',' We just bought a house and I have gotten so many ideas from here. ','?'
'id: 67875 ',' Just what you need to pass the time waiting for the elevator. ','?'
'id: 67879 ',' Pinterest is a great site and the app makes it super easy to navigate through it, although there are a few things that you must do on the computer that you cant do on the app, like change the order of your boards. ','?'
'id: 67879 ',' My only problem has been that sometimes it will close on me if i try to pin from a website with many images or if i have been using it nonstop for hours. ','?'
'id: 67879 ',' I highly recommend it though. ','?'
'id: 67884 ',' I like how you can push and hold the picture to pin it, but now you can  t like the pin without clicking on the picture. ','?'
'id: 67890 ',' My only problem with it is that it takes up so much space on my iphone! ','?'
'id: 67905 ',' No complaints except that it crashes when I try to view an extremely long pin. ','?'
'id: 67912 ',' Now you have to open the pin to them re pin or like it. ','?'
'id: 67912 ',' They should at least add the "like" option to the page. ','?'
'id: 67915 ',' Also REALLY wish it would tell me when I  d already pinned/repinned something!! ','?'
'id: 67917 ',' I LOVVVVVVE that u have added the already pinned warning! ','?'
'id: 67918 ',' Please never take this away, after so many pins I forget what I have already pinned and it  s so so nice to be warned before. ','?'
'id: 67918 ',' I know you can click and hold the picture, but I feel like it takes a bit longer. ','?'
'id: 67918 ',' Obviously not a HUGE deal, but if I had to choose, it would be the way it was :)\\n\\nBesides that, I LOVE PINTEREST! ','?'
'id: 67918 ',' That version is still I where you actually have to click on the picture, get it to full screen, then you can repin. ','?'
'id: 67918 ',' I wish I could use it more so please work on that update too! ','?'
'id: 67923 ',' but it crashes on my phone wayyyy too much it gets quite annoying because I can  t just reopen it and be where I was before I have to find my place again and again and again , ','?'
'id: 67925 ',' I like many new features but hate that I can no longer quickly use the like button. ','?'
'id: 67925 ',' Please bring back the like button on the main feed :( , ','?'
'id: 67931 ',' Why in the world would you take away the like button? ','?'
'id: 67936 ',' The app is quick and easy and has never had a problem. ','?'
'id: 67937 ',' Please bring it back. ','?'
'id: 67963 ',' Please fix the bug that happens when clicking on a link to a website  s Pinterest account from within the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 67963 ',' Makes no sense that you can  t go to a Pinterest account link when you  re in the Pinterest app! ','?'
'id: 67963 ',' Would be nice to have the number of news items on the iPad like on the iPhone app. ','?'
'id: 67964 ',' Please bring back the like button. ','?'
'id: 67965 ',' I get so many good ideas on how to wear my clothes for work and play! ','?'
'id: 67971 ',' Though, I rated it four stars because it crashes A LOT and sometimes doesn  t load when you  re trying to pin stuff from the Internet. ','?'
'id: 67973 ',' This has happened after every update and I  d love it to be fixed! ','?'
'id: 67974 ',' I don  t like the fact that when you re pin something you can  t access the original source within the app. ','?'
'id: 67979 ',' ashleynicole425 ,  I hate that the like button was taken off the feed so you have to open pin to like it or repin something. ','?'
'id: 67979 ',' Never fails and I hate it. ','?'
'id: 67987 ',' Latest update has made this app much less user friendly. ','?'
'id: 67987 ',' Please fix these problems, we all love Pinterest!! ','?'
'id: 67989 ',' One big thing is  with the update  you have to tap on the actual pin before you can like and pin it. ','?'
'id: 67989 ',' My HUGE issue with the update is that it  s, well, HUGE! ','?'
'id: 67989 ',' Despite my love for Pinterest, I had to delete the app because of all the space it takes up. ','?'
'id: 67991 ',' Jj207611 ,  With the newest update you have to click on the pin to like, unlike, or comment on it. ','?'
'id: 68002 ',' I love this app it  s awesome because all of the great pins this app is wonderful and I  m glad they made it , ','?'
'id: 68003 ',' I hope it could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 68004 ',' Everytime you want to pin/like something, you have to click on it, wait forever for it to load, then you can find the pin/like buttons. ','?'
'id: 68004 ',' Please fix this!!!! ','?'
'id: 68010 ',' Tried to delete the app &amp; my phone crashed. ','?'
'id: 68011 ',' Please put the "pin" button back. ','?'
'id: 68012 ',' I like that you can hold down on the picture to repin it, but you too away the like button on my main feed. ','?'
'id: 68014 ',' Please fix the memory issue!! ','?'
'id: 68016 ',' Please fix it, otherwise I  ll have to delete the app due to space constraints on my phone. ','?'
'id: 68017 ',' Now as I scroll through the popular page, without a doubt, it always crashes! ','?'
'id: 68017 ',' Please add the like button again. ','?'
'id: 68018 ',' It  s been a couple months now and this STILL has not been fixed! ','?'
'id: 68019 ',' So you have to actually click on a picture to view it then you can like it, rather than how it was from the main page. ','?'
'id: 68020 ',' Agreed this used to be my favorite app but it crashes several times per use. ','?'
'id: 68020 ',' Please change this back. ','?'
'id: 68023 ',' Please change it back! ','?'
'id: 68024 ',' I hate that you have to open the thumbs to be able to like something. ','?'
'id: 68027 ',' But I love Pinterest so I still recommend it if you don  t have pintrist. ','?'
'id: 68027 ',' I just want them to fix the update! ','?'
'id: 68028 ',' I have 2 problems with this app\\n1. ','?'
'id: 68028 ',' Please put it back I hate having to click on the picture to like it! ','?'
'id: 68028 ',' This app ALWAYS crashes and it drives me insane! ','?'
'id: 68028 ',' \\nI also think it would be awesome if you could make it an option to hold your finger down on the pictures and have the option to save them to your camera roll , ','?'
'id: 68029 ',' You have to click on the picture to access it. ','?'
'id: 68031 ',' I like how you can hold down a pin and add it to your boards. ','?'
'id: 68031 ',' Two things that should be added is a cover changer and the ability to add pictures. ','?'
'id: 68035 ',' My app hardly crashed before the update. ','?'
'id: 68037 ',' The last up date y  all did kicked me out and can  t log back in please fix soon. ','?'
'id: 68039 ',' I thought the new app and update was pretty stable until I realized it took up OVER 3 GB OF MY IPAD STORAGE! ','?'
'id: 68039 ',' I look at pins...why does it take up so much space? ','?'
'id: 68041 ',' The app randomly crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 68046 ',' Please put option back. ','?'
'id: 68047 ',' Please bring back two columns. ','?'
'id: 68050 ',' The most recent update now requires me to login everytime I want to use it. ','?'
'id: 68056 ',' Absolutely hate that I now have click on the image just to repin or like something. ','?'
'id: 68057 ',' I was charged to update my Pinterest ! ','?'
'id: 68059 ',' It  s a great idea but the new feature where you hold down on a pin and you are able to pin to your own board more quickly is annoying when your scrolling and accidentally keep your finger on something too long that you don  t want to pin. ','?'
'id: 68065 ',' I also like that you can press and hold an image to pin it. ','?'
'id: 68065 ',' If that could be fixed, along with the other issues, I would be extremely grateful and would probably change my rating from 3 stars to 5. ','?'
'id: 68067 ',' Yeah it was crashing, but it was so much easier to pin. ','?'
'id: 68068 ',' But it crashes a lot, fix that then i give it 5 * , ','?'
'id: 68069 ',' I haven  t had problems since the latest update. ','?'
'id: 68071 ',' Why change it? ','?'
'id: 68072 ',' I don  t even need to go on my desktop to use all of the capabilities. ','?'
'id: 68074 ',' Please fix the crashing problem! ','?'
'id: 68079 ',' Ever since I updated my Pinterest app, it won  t stop crashing! ','?'
'id: 68079 ',' I can  t look at anything on it! ','?'
'id: 68082 ',' All you have to do is tap and hold the picture until it pops up your boards. ','?'
'id: 68083 ',' I have encountered a few minor glitches, the most annoying is it crashes sometimes often. ','?'
'id: 68083 ',' I would like to see the items that are for sale  and items without directions clearly marked. ','?'
'id: 68084 ',' I had to delete this app bc my phone just would not work when it was installed due to the space it kept eating up. ','?'
'id: 68085 ',' I HATE that you can  t do that. ','?'
'id: 68087 ',' Its fast other than it crashing a lot. ','?'
'id: 68088 ',' But I hate how on this update you can  t repin unless you  re on the single pin. ','?'
'id: 68089 ',' I need it back...it  s not easier to just tap to repin, it  s a PAIN! ','?'
'id: 68093 ',' On the homepage looking at friends pins I don  t like that I can  t click repin or like right there like we used to. ','?'
'id: 68094 ',' But I can  t deal with this new update! ','?'
'id: 68094 ',' I miss the   like   button, and whenever I hold the picture to pin something it lags and after a few pins it crashes! ','?'
'id: 68094 ',' Please fix this, I  m sure I  m not the only one unhappy. ','?'
'id: 68098 ',' Why did you take away the pin it and like it button? ','?'
'id: 68098 ',' Now I have to click on the picture if I want to pin it. ','?'
'id: 68101 ',' Please change this! ','?'
'id: 68102 ',' \\n\\nIf you just stop updating it would be the best app ever. ','?'
'id: 68103 ',' \\n One thing that would make it better is sub folders for example I could have a folder called for the home and sub folders titled kitchen, bathroom, bedroom. ','?'
'id: 68104 ',' Overall, I like it, but now you have to click on the pin to like it. ','?'
'id: 68106 ',' I LOVE pinterest, but the app is terrible  the screen freezes and then the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 68109 ',' Ms. Superstar ,  Why oh why do I need to sign in to Pinterest now? ','?'
'id: 68112 ',' I had to remove the app because it was taking up nearly 6GB of memory. ','?'
'id: 68114 ',' The only way to fix it is to uninstall the app and add it back on. ','?'
'id: 68114 ',' When I uninstalled the app my whole phone crashed. ','?'
'id: 68115 ',' Why did you take away the ability to like and pin directly in the newsfeed? ','?'
'id: 68122 ',' and repin buttons from the pins while searching, now you have to click on the pin, wait for it to load, scroll down and THEN pin it! ','?'
'id: 68122 ',' Just bring back the old way of pinning and liking now! ','?'
'id: 68123 ',' \\nAlso, when you do repin things, you have to scroll through all your boards to do so. ','?'
'id: 68128 ',' Every other upgrade has been great, but this problem is a huge annoyance. ','?'
'id: 68129 ',' Why is the like button under each pin on the app gone? ','?'
'id: 68130 ',' Now we can  t quickly scroll through and even "like" a pin without having to click on it and open it full screen. ','?'
'id: 68131 ',' Like the upgrade but still closes suddenly while adding new pins to my boards. ','?'
'id: 68132 ',' It doesn  t make any sense to me that the new update calls for quicker pinning, yet after the update you now have to click the actual pin before you have any choices with it! ','?'
'id: 68132 ',' It  s not quicker when you have to click on it! ','?'
'id: 68133 ',' Why would you do that?!?!!? ','?'
'id: 68134 ',' Why are they intent on making the app user unfriendly? ','?'
'id: 68134 ',' Why do they hate pinners so much? ','?'
'id: 68139 ',' I love the fact that we  re now able to search our own pins, &amp; the warning when we  ve already pinned something; however the crashing bug has not been fixed, they removed the repin button from the small scale pins so now you must leave your scrolling to maximize the pin, and the app still caches photos which takes up a lot of memory. ','?'
'id: 68139 ',' Pinterest is great, but I would suggest accessing it from the computer for the time being. ','?'
'id: 68141 ',' While I love Pinterest and this app, I only gave it 4 stars because it crashes often and most recently, I discovered that every time I open the app it takes more of my storage space on my phone! ','?'
'id: 68141 ',' I noticed this when I was unable to download an app bc of lack of space. ','?'
'id: 68141 ',' Knowing there was no way I had used all 13 gb on my 4s, I immediately went to my settings...much to my surprise I discovered Pinterest was taking up 7 GB of space!! ','?'
'id: 68142 ',' When the update stalls  and stays frozen then we have a problem . ','?'
'id: 68146 ',' I totally recommend it! ','?'
'id: 68147 ',' The Pinterest app just had an update and unfortunately it was for the worst! ','?'
'id: 68147 ',' I hate how you have to tap the picture to just heart it when before there was a heart button that you could easily tap. ','?'
'id: 68149 ',' why did you take away the "like" and "repin" buttons? ','?'
'id: 68149 ',' What happened? ','?'
'id: 68151 ',' Why is this? ','?'
'id: 68154 ',' I can  t even look at anything, it just crashes!!! ','?'
'id: 68157 ',' Now you have to click and pull up a big picture in order to repin it. ','?'
'id: 68160 ',' I don  t like how the pin and the like buttons aren  t in the picture and how you have to go all the way into the pin to like it! ','?'
'id: 68160 ',' Please change it back! ','?'
'id: 68165 ',' It does not work well for me. ','?'
'id: 68165 ',' I think you need to rethink this. ','?'
'id: 68167 ',' When I went in and found you could clear the cache, I tried clearing it and my phone locked up and then crashed. ','?'
'id: 68167 ',' The app should not be allowed to store so much, there needs to be a cut off and maybe it could clear itself when you exit the app. ','?'
'id: 68167 ',' Anyway, great app but please fix the cache issue. ','?'
'id: 68168 ',' Please fix any issues w/your app. ','?'
'id: 68169 ',' In iPhone u can  t pin to a board from the small image like we used to. ','?'
'id: 68173 ',' I love the app better than the computer version but now you have to click on a picture instead of just seeing it in the queue and pressing the repin button. ','?'
'id: 68174 ',' Now you have to click on the image to do that. ','?'
'id: 68175 ',' My phone hasn  t been able to download the latest version and I have no idea what the problem is , ','?'
'id: 68179 ',' Please put those buttons back. ','?'
'id: 68180 ',' It just crashed 4 times in the last 2 minutes, until I gave up. ','?'
'id: 68180 ',' \\n\\nPinterest   please fix this! ','?'
'id: 68186 ',' Now it  s crashing and making me log back in everytime I close the app. ','?'
'id: 68186 ',' And please add the repin button back. ','?'
'id: 68187 ',' With the new update, the icons are smaller as to make more pins available at one time. ','?'
'id: 68188 ',' I don  t like this new one because you have to click on the picture to then click on "pin it" and I hate that. ','?'
'id: 68190 ',' \\n\\nAnd it still crashes. ','?'
'id: 68193 ',' This app takes up so much spaces and is constantly crashing. ','?'
'id: 68193 ',' It is very aggravating when something catches your eye and you go to pin it but guess what the app decides to crash. ','?'
'id: 68195 ',' Now you have to click the picture just to like it and it always takes forever to load for me. ','?'
'id: 68196 ',' How is that easier? ','?'
'id: 68201 ',' The update before that one was AMAZING but this one where you have to double tap the pin doesn  t work. ','?'
'id: 68201 ',' I wish there was some way to change which way you pin. ','?'
'id: 68203 ',' Why can  t we have a pin option without having to open the whole thing?? ','?'
'id: 68207 ',' Since updated a couple of hours ago, app has crashed three times!!! ','?'
'id: 68209 ',' Why was the "email pin" feature removed? ','?'
'id: 68211 ',' Just opened up the app after the newest upgrade and I  m speechless! ','?'
'id: 68211 ',' I just hope it doesn  t have problems crashing, the more I play around with it. ','?'
'id: 68214 ',' But with the new update, you can no longer pin or like things from the main board, you actually have to click into the pin to repin it, and that is awful, infuriating, a waste of time, and a huge step backward. ','?'
'id: 68215 ',' I don  t like how you can  t pin or like now without clicking picture, and I really don  t like that there are no letters on side now when repinning, it was a lot easier before updates. ','?'
'id: 68215 ',' I just hope they har another update to fix these issues. ','?'
'id: 68219 ',' Updated it this morning and wish I didn  t. Now you have to click into an image to like or pin it. ','?'
'id: 68219 ',' \\n\\nPinterest programming gurus  please fix this mistake!!!! ','?'
'id: 68222 ',' One thing I don  t like about the new update is that you have to click on the picture to go to another page, just to like it. ','?'
'id: 68223 ',' \\nAlso the popular page is all just photos with no descriptions, please bring them back. ','?'
'id: 68227 ',' Just love it! ','?'
'id: 68228 ',' My friend has an iPod 4 and she tried to download the new update and it has completely crashed it to where it  s not working at all (turning itself on and off) so be very cautious!! ','?'
'id: 68229 ',' TMRains6 ,  Just did the update and I don  t like the quick pin. ','?'
'id: 68230 ',' I just don  t like having to tap every single pin just to repin or like if that makes any since. ','?'
'id: 68230 ',' Please bring this feature back. ','?'
'id: 68235 ',' So glad they added something that lets you know when you  ve already pinned something! ','?'
'id: 68252 ',' My friend recently had to have her phone reset because this app used up all of her memory and when I checked how much of my memory Pinterest was using is was up to 6 gigs of memory! ','?'
'id: 68260 ',' Now we just need to add more secret boards. ','?'
'id: 68264 ',' Everyone should have this!!! ','?'
'id: 68273 ',' Once I figured out how to use it on my iPod I haven  t been able to stop! ','?'
'id: 68275 ',' This app is easy to use and rarely has issues. ','?'
'id: 68278 ',' Rarely crashes, user friendly, and is a cut above other such apps. ','?'
'id: 68295 ',' This gives me so many creative ideas, just love this app , ','?'
'id: 68296 ',' It  s hard to take the time to learn all the new, cool features, because I get sucked in to looking over all the pins, which leads to new sites, which leads to, well  you get the picture :)\\nI learn something new and useful every time I am on this site, and I can  t think of any other site this would apply to. ','?'
'id: 68297 ',' It crashes often. ','?'
'id: 68297 ',' Please fix that. ','?'
'id: 68326 ',' I love Pinterest and the app is well laid out and easily searchable, however it often crashes and says   no pins available   for categories where there should be millions of pins...not sure why it does that, but it would be nice to see it fixed somehow. ','?'
'id: 68332 ',' When I don  t know what to wear, cook, plant, buy, or decorate...and when I just need a laugh! ','?'
'id: 68339 ',' This site is like a big bag of chips.1 is not enough and you can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 68340 ',' Now they need to create a Pinterest anonymous to treat all us addicts , ','?'
'id: 68343 ',' I just LOVE PINTEREST!!! ','?'
'id: 68348 ',' It has helped me create my dream wedding! ','?'
'id: 68349 ',' I think I need to attend rehab for my Pinterest addiction &amp; this app is an enabler! ','?'
'id: 68354 ',' There are so many great ideas for every part of your life. ','?'
'id: 68355 ',' Easy to use, hasn  t crashed, and is great for passing the time! ','?'
'id: 68362 ',' I do wish there was a way to pin on several boards and to let you know if you have already pinned something! ','?'
'id: 68362 ',' First 2 days I spent all day on it and thanks to Pinterest I made a very inexpensive wedding look glamorous! ','?'
'id: 68367 ',' There are so many ideas on these boards, one can never run out of projects! ','?'
'id: 68367 ',' My favorite addition Pinterest has made are the secret boards. ','?'
'id: 68375 ',' I am addicted to pinterest but I had to delete the app because I was using all the storage on my iPhone! ','?'
'id: 68375 ',' Is there any way it can be changed so it doesn  t take up so much storage?! ','?'
'id: 68381 ',' The only problem is mind force quits often, but that could be my fault for not having the new update. ','?'
'id: 68381 ',' If you are addicted to the site like I am, you need the app to go along with it! ','?'
'id: 68388 ',' The one thing missing is a "Scroll to Top" tab like the one available when Pinterest is opened in a browser. ','?'
'id: 68390 ',' Everything is here at your fingertips. ','?'
'id: 68393 ',' \\nAnd THANK YOU PINTEREST for listening to your users and adding the options they requested!!! ','?'
'id: 68394 ',' \\n\\nThe last software update has a bug that I hope will be resolved soon. ','?'
'id: 68395 ',' I like having picture references for things I find on the Web. ','?'
'id: 68399 ',' The app is better than the desktop site although I wish you could scroll thru pins instead of having to click each one. ','?'
'id: 68421 ',' But I guess you can just post it twice. ','?'
'id: 68425 ',' I recommend it to everyone!! ','?'
'id: 68425 ',' The only thing that needs to get fixed is sometimes it won  t let u pin. ','?'
'id: 68426 ',' Like a few others have said, it gets overwhelmed and crashes occasionally, and it would be great if that was fixed. ','?'
'id: 68437 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 68440 ',' I started to enjoy cooking again, I plan my meals everyday around the recipes I find on pinterest. ','?'
'id: 68440 ',' After 37 years of cooking for my family I needed some fresh ideas. ','?'
'id: 68441 ',' This app comes in very handy when I need to come up with a recipe quick and I  m at the store :D , ','?'
'id: 68470 ',' I think EVERYONE should have this app! ','?'
'id: 68484 ',' The only thing I recommend is to be able to add contacts by email address or name , ','?'
'id: 68485 ',' I get frustrated when I can  t pin something though. ','?'
'id: 68493 ',' but it crashes sometimes, there are a LOT of repeated pins and at times the pins in a category have nothing to do with the subject?! ','?'
'id: 68497 ',' I don  t want push notifications, it needs to be simpler to decline that option!!!! ','?'
'id: 68523 ',' I can  t!!! ','?'
'id: 68526 ',' I have been using this app since it has come out and have never had a problem with it! ','?'
'id: 68529 ',' Anything and everything you wanted to know and more! ','?'
'id: 68537 ',' Love it   exactly what my Pinterest addiction needed. ','?'
'id: 68541 ',' Pinterest is a wonderful way to translate what you are, what you want and what you need. ','?'
'id: 68543 ',' I  ve not had glitch issues as others have. ','?'
'id: 68551 ',' many of the bugs I had issues with before have been fixed :) I  m an addict!! ','?'
'id: 68560 ',' I never have problems with it. ','?'
'id: 68562 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 68566 ',' Very addictive and the app just makes it so I  m on it twice as much. ','?'
'id: 68569 ',' I love love love the app and Pinterest but it  s locks up and crashes A LOT please fix this it  s very obnoxious , ','?'

'id: 70325 ',' I have made so many recipes, crafts, and gotten great ideas for the kids! ','?'
'id: 70326 ',' I have no issues with it and will continue to use it. ','?'
'id: 70328 ',' As with most people I know, I spend far too much time finding things I think I need to know or have. ','?'
'id: 70334 ',' I have never had a problem with this app. ','?'
'id: 70337 ',' I recommend  this to everyone because I think just about everyone could find something of interest. ','?'
'id: 70364 ',' I do wish there was a way to search only the boards of people you follow though! ','?'
'id: 70373 ',' I can  t stop pinning, even after suffering an injury trying out one of the DIY  s! ','?'
'id: 70374 ',' I use it all the time and have never had any problems!! ','?'
'id: 70379 ',' The only thing I wish you could do is turn your existing boards to private. ','?'
'id: 70380 ',' No complaints works exactly as I need it to. ','?'
'id: 70391 ',' I am wonderfully amazed with the strides this website/app has made. ','?'
'id: 70394 ',' Every thing I need !! ','?'
'id: 70399 ',' I do have problems with the app " force quitting" then it just shuts down. ','?'
'id: 70408 ',' The send feature even let  s me hook new people on Pinterest by showing them what they are missing out on. ','?'
'id: 70416 ',' Every thing I always wanted, i can have on Pinterest, plus you get to meet people from all over the world! ','?'
'id: 70420 ',' It will sit on one frame and then jump when it finally does scroll. ','?'
'id: 70423 ',' I  m up to almost 2GB and the only solution is to uninstall the app. ','?'
'id: 70423 ',' #fail , ','?'
'id: 70425 ',' but, it crashes a lot! ','?'
'id: 70428 ',' If you want to no longer have a life, or plan on viewing life in a totally different and depressing perspective, get Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 70431 ',' The update only made ot better. ','?'
'id: 70444 ',' The only thing is I wish I would tell you when you  ve already pinned something so you don  t pin it twice! ','?'
'id: 70444 ',' I recommend this to everyone! ','?'
'id: 70449 ',' Steeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeve ,  Most of the time it  s fun BUT people need to be more mature in what they say and what pictures they post. ','?'
'id: 70455 ',' It  s got everything I need for all the areas of my life: organization, crafts, decorations, holidays, fashion! ','?'
'id: 70456 ',' Ideas on this site have save me when I forgot to prepare for a Girl Scout meeting. ','?'
'id: 70481 ',' I wish it wasn  t so sensitive to side swiping you can click on something the wrong way and poof it  s gone because it swiped to another page. ','?'
'id: 70497 ',' I love surfing sites for a project I  m working on, pinning the item I need and then later coming back to my board and comparing. ','?'
'id: 70497 ',' No more taking notes, I just pin and compare any time. ','?'
'id: 70498 ',' I would only suggest more secret boards! ','?'
'id: 70498 ',' My non existent future wedding needs more than 3 boards to categorize everything! ','?'
'id: 70505 ',' \\nI think you need to add a done it button so u can click it when u completed a pin\\n\\nAlso have sub boards ex\\nMain board Christmas\\nThen when u click on it u have opinion of clicking\\nFood\\nDecorations \\nIdeas \\n\\nOr something like that , ','?'
'id: 70506 ',' Okay, okay, I need to stop fangirling, but I seriously can  t stop talking about Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 70506 ',' The only bad thing I have to say is that it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 70506 ',' If it could be fixed in the next update, that would be FABULOUS!! ','?'
'id: 70508 ',' When I browse while on the iPad, it crashes very often! ','?'
'id: 70511 ',' I really enjoy PINterest but this app constantly crashes on my iPad (1st generation). ','?'
'id: 70511 ',' I update as necessary but the app still crashes. ','?'
'id: 70520 ',' The ideas on Pinterest are so inspiring! ','?'
'id: 70523 ',' I keep getting kicked back to the top of a page or the app just crashes. ','?'
'id: 70526 ',' Could spend hours on this, would love to have reminder settings in each category, I forget to look at for example my recipes when at grocery store. ','?'
'id: 70539 ',' I highly recommend getting it. ','?'
'id: 70556 ',' The only thing I don  t know how to do is to add my own images for others to see. ','?'
'id: 70560 ',' I can easily access my pins and update my boards. ','?'
'id: 70564 ',' But the iPad app could use a different layout. ','?'
'id: 70569 ',' Ionta ,  Just love all the ideas on here. ','?'
'id: 70590 ',' I recommend this a lot it is great. ','?'
'id: 70597 ',' I even post items I have to sale! ','?'
'id: 70599 ',' You have to make yourself get off. ','?'
'id: 70610 ',' So many simple ideas that are great!! ','?'
'id: 70613 ',' There are so many cute ideas! ','?'
'id: 70628 ',' This app is very fluid and hasn  t crashed on me at all. ','?'
'id: 70630 ',' However, lately Pinterest has a new layout every other day; while all the updates are great and I  ve like every one of them, it would be nice if Pinterest looked the same for a little while and I got used to using new features. ','?'
'id: 70632 ',' But when I click on things to make them bigger, the app randomly crashes. ','?'
'id: 70636 ',' There are so many great ideas on Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 70636 ',' You do have to double check the credibility of some information that is pinned but you have to check credibility when using the Internet anyway. ','?'
'id: 70636 ',' In the new version make sure you change the comment before you choose the board to post it to :). ','?'
'id: 70645 ',' I am not on Pinterest everyday, but log on whenever I feel I need to   get away  . ','?'
'id: 70645 ',' I would like to see Pinterest monitor what is pinned more closely! ','?'
'id: 70648 ',' I have noticed I can search when using it on my laptop but am unable to search with the app. ','?'
'id: 70649 ',' Great app, wish there was a did it button , ','?'
'id: 70653 ',' I really love this app, but maybe if you could have tabs open like a web browser I would be better. ','?'
'id: 70659 ',' Never have a problem with it!!! ','?'
'id: 70663 ',' beebossvc ,  I love it and can  t stop looking at things. ','?'
'id: 70670 ',' T arudahl ,  I can  t log in to the app! ','?'
'id: 70673 ',' I use it everyday and have had no problems. ','?'
'id: 70675 ',' I have found and made many recipes, gotten great craft ideas and more. ','?'
'id: 70678 ',' \\n\\nThat said, the most recent, FULL update added a lot of functionality. ','?'
'id: 70678 ',' You can finally add new pins with the app, instead of just repinning other people  s stuff, which was a seriously lame oversight on the developers   part the first time around. ','?'
'id: 70678 ',' \\n\\nI still think the way the app handles scrolling with the weird vanishing menu bar is annoying as all get out, and I hate that the bar pops back up at the slightest downward swipe, generally obscuring whatever I went back up to look at, so minus another star for that. ','?'
'id: 70679 ',' You can see everything, you can become inspired to make something, be taught on how to do something you  ve always wanted to do. ','?'
'id: 70686 ',' Like the reviewer before me it would be AMAZING if there was a "done this" or "did it" button where we could give a little review and show pics of what we have made, baked, created etc etc.\\nBut other than that this app rocks! ','?'
'id: 70687 ',' Watch out because once you start you can not stop! ','?'
'id: 70743 ',' BUT I  m annoyed at the update added that allows you to Repin, but seems to not let you add a new note. ','?'
'id: 70744 ',' It is amazing what you can find. ','?'
'id: 70749 ',' I love all the inspiration and ideas from other people, it would be nice to have a "from me" board you can post pictures on. ','?'
'id: 70750 ',' Love it   though wish there was a more advanced filter system, including ability to exclude pins you  ve seen before? ','?'
'id: 70759 ',' As soon as it crashes less it will be perfection. ','?'
'id: 70761 ',' I need Pinterest like I need food, water and sleep. ','?'
'id: 70776 ',' Just download it, you  ll love it : ) , ','?'
'id: 70784 ',' I go here every time I need inspiration for parties or any event I  m planning. ','?'
'id: 70790 ',' The only problem I have found is that the app freezes when I try to pin anything from the web. ','?'
'id: 70793 ',' This app crashes soooo much! ','?'
'id: 70794 ',' Just keep pinning! ','?'
'id: 70804 ',' \\n\\nThank you to all the talented millions who have amazing ideas: the fearless designers who think far outside the box, the original stylists who are propelling trends, the photographers who snap mind blowing pictures, the graphic artists who wildly wield their cursors, the thinkers who post both silly and meaningful quotes, the knowers and teachers who generously share how tos. ','?'
'id: 70804 ',' The I pad app allows better viewing, but often gets overloaded and crashes; plus there are still many, many steps to pin. ','?'
'id: 70812 ',' \\n\\nI think it would be super useful to have some more ways to search. ','?'
'id: 70817 ',' Also the pins that are considered spam should be deleted , ','?'
'id: 70828 ',' When I need ideas or solutions, Pinterest is the very thing I check first! ','?'
'id: 70832 ',' For iPad 1, it has few bugs and is easy to use. ','?'
'id: 70842 ',' Nice but needs more functions , ','?'
'id: 70853 ',' Seriously what were we doing before Pinterest!? ','?'
'id: 70853 ',' It like having your own real   fairy god mother   to clean you up &amp; get you ready for the ball, with quick, easy &amp; cheap tricks!! ','?'
'id: 70855 ',' but I would love to see sub boards. ','?'
'id: 70855 ',' Also, it would be easier to have a "move to" button on all of your pins that way if they end up in the wrong board you can just move it to the correct one. ','?'
'id: 70858 ',' Their updates really update and improve the app! ','?'
'id: 70868 ',' Very few things that could be fixed but not enough to keep me away. ','?'
'id: 70868 ',' Please tell me when I  ve already Pinned something. ','?'
'id: 70870 ',' If you need ideas on anything, you will find it here. ','?'
'id: 70871 ',' \\n\\nYou use to be able to pin pictures from your phone camera library, now you can only take a picture or use a website. ','?'
'id: 70880 ',' There is nothing on pinterest that you can not find information on. ','?'
'id: 70891 ',' Every woman needs one! ','?'
'id: 70906 ',' I highly suggest it. ','?'
'id: 70911 ',' The app definitely needs unlimited secret boards first, or otherwise create a version in which you don  t need to share. ','?'
'id: 70911 ',' \\n\\nI would like to use this app locally to just save and store my own bookmarks. ','?'
'id: 70932 ',' I just love this app. ','?'
'id: 70932 ',' Recipes, decorating, how to  s, fashion, everything you need to know without googling. ','?'
'id: 70934 ',' My daughter  in law is planning one of her friends bachelorette party and it is great that even if the person looks at her page she can not see the idea board. ','?'
'id: 70934 ',' I really would like to see more diversified categories for many more search choices in the future. ','?'
'id: 70935 ',' It does, however, close out at inappropriate times, hope this will be fixed in the near future. ','?'
'id: 70947 ',' I would love if there was a   did it   button! ','?'
'id: 70963 ',' I never have issues with the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 70999 ',' I love it   whenever I need an idea for what to do with the kids, a party theme, or gardening how toos   this is the place I go! ','?'
'id: 71000 ',' Highly recommend it:) , ','?'
'id: 71010 ',' I love the ideas that are on here and I love coming up with ways to have my daughters parties and do things myself!!!! ','?'
'id: 71016 ','  I just downloaded this app one week ago, and I use it everyday! ','?'
'id: 71017 ',' If you don  t pin you need to start. ','?'
'id: 71030 ',' The newest version of the app supports an easier re pinning interface where you don  t have to open additional menus to pin to a different board. ','?'
'id: 71042 ',' Wish I could create many more secret boards though! ','?'
'id: 71056 ',' \\n\\n Would be better if, at sign up, there was complete instruction and understanding of the site. ','?'
'id: 71056 ',' I tried some ideas and they needed a bit of changing or they didn,t work. ','?'
'id: 71056 ',' Sometimes a pin is far removed from its first pinning and loses the orig. ','?'
'id: 71058 ',' But every second I go on and edit it crashes constantly and I hate that but everything else is just wonderful! ','?'
'id: 71059 ',' \\n\\nMy only critique: the back arrow is pinned to the top of the screen, so it  s inconvenient when you tap on a pin to see it up close, scroll down to see the whole thing, and then have to scroll back up to get back to the main board you were looking at. ','?'
'id: 71064 ',' Really pretty, solves all my troubles getting pins into the right folders, hasn  t crashed on me at all. ','?'
'id: 71065 ',' Wish more sites would allow pinning from mobile devices. ','?'
'id: 71069 ',' I really like this app, however, I think it would be a good idea if a person who wants to see one of my secret boards on their device, could click on it and type in the password. ','?'
'id: 71082 ',' Just love this app I use the food and drink one all the time. ','?'
'id: 71097 ',' Pinterest is the best app they have EVER created!! ','?'
'id: 71101 ',' Fantastic but needs a better Interface when logging categories. ','?'
'id: 71103 ',' I love Pinterest but the app crashes every now and then but no major problems so far! ','?'
'id: 71107 ',' It operates fine on the computer, but needs some fixing. ','?'
'id: 71121 ',' If your looking for something just type it in the search engine and it almost always has what your  looking for. ','?'
'id: 71124 ',' I just did the update. ','?'
'id: 71124 ',' I am unable to log in. ','?'
'id: 71124 ',' In less than an hour, it was fixed. ','?'
'id: 71126 ',' Whoever created it and whoever created those ideas deserve to be much appreciated! ','?'
'id: 71137 ',' There are so many great ideas and products. ','?'
'id: 71154 ',' I just wish that the pages that have been deleted on the Internet could be deleted on here too. ','?'
'id: 71163 ',' Never crashes, refreshes frequently and never freezes. ','?'
'id: 71169 ',' I recommend this app without hesitation. ','?'
'id: 71180 ',' Since I had to delete my Pinterest app, I have been trying to use the website through Safari, but the mobile site only shows one picture at a time, and there is no way to scroll back up to the top quickly. ','?'
'id: 71192 ',' Last week I was at the grocery and forgot the ingredients for a recipe on my Pinterest board. ','?'
'id: 71192 ',' I was instantly linked to my boards and able to find what I needed! ','?'
'id: 71196 ',' The app hardly ever crashes anymore. ','?'
'id: 71197 ',' The only thing I have a problem with it doesn  t pull up all the pins, it stops and you have to reload up some new ones. ','?'
'id: 71197 ',' Guess I need to work on being more patience. ','?'
'id: 71201 ',' I just wish the Pinterest would tell us where they were taken or from. ','?'
'id: 71202 ',' The only improvement I can suggest is to notify users when they  re trying to pin something they  ve already pinned. ','?'
'id: 71213 ',' Always could use improvement but I still use it everyday! ','?'
'id: 71220 ',' To pin stuff and explore things you like is easy but I know there is a lot more to it I don  t quite understand yet, for instance linking to my Facebook and following people I didn  t even know you could do until months later. ','?'
'id: 71223 ',' One reviewer suggested a "Did It" button along with an option to post a pic of the accomplishment. ','?'
'id: 71231 ',' There are a few issues with opening pins to find something entirely different than the expected recipe. ','?'
'id: 71237 ',' Very addicting, can  t wait to close on my house so my wife and I can use the ideas we have found. ','?'
'id: 71253 ',' This needs to be fixed. ','?'
'id: 71256 ',' I can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 71259 ',' Love it, but recently having trouble with it crashing when I want to reorganize some of my boards. ','?'
'id: 71264 ',' I rarely crash and what I can  t do with my IPad I switch to my computer. ','?'
'id: 71275 ',' Great but the refresh feature needs to work better. ','?'
'id: 71277 ',' I like that I can create new boards mid pin and search for anything, just like if I was on line. ','?'
'id: 71288 ',' I would like to see new DIY posts people! ','?'
'id: 71289 ',' I really highly recommend this app!!! ','?'
'id: 71291 ',' \\n\\nJune: in the last 3 minutes the app had crashed over 5 times while trying to edit a pin. ','?'
'id: 71308 ',' I just wish there was a way to get rid of pins that are just pictures of a project that have no link to instructions/recipe/etc , ','?'
'id: 71321 ',' This app never fails to keep me entertained and engaged in beautiful ideas and new inspiration. ','?'
'id: 71328 ',' I have never had any problems out of it. ','?'
'id: 71336 ',' One suggestion   can we please have the ability to create more secret boards! ','?'
'id: 71343 ',' That was a great idea whoever thought of it. ','?'
'id: 71347 ',' But I think there should be a button that people have to click if they did something and knows that it works!! ','?'
'id: 71355 ',' Don  t know why I waited so long to get this app, I recommend it all the time to my friends and family....and they get addicted too! ','?'
'id: 71360 ',' However, I have a really hard Ti,e trying to figure out how to pin something originally from a website!! ','?'
'id: 71373 ',' Would also like to have the ability to pin to more than one board at a time. ','?'
'id: 71380 ',' But I got sweat stains out of my favorite shirts (hence the stains), having a friend build a nail polish shelf for me, have new nail art for the entire year, learned how to make a maxi skirt, that a grey wall does not look like a prison it actually looks really nice with the right accents, told my son how to build a fire pit in the backyard of his brand new house, and how to make skittles vodka to go with the monkey bread that is also addicting. ','?'
'id: 71415 ',' I could use it for hours. ','?'
'id: 71427 ',' I love the content but my app constantly crashes, doesn  t let me sign out and the boards freeze. ','?'
'id: 71434 ',' I  d like to have more secret boards for gifts and things, but other than that, love Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 71443 ',' There are awesome ideas for everything here!!! ','?'
'id: 71453 ',' Thanks to Pinterest, I have made door wreaths, grew in my eyebrows, purchased a blender and made the most delicious smoothies and the lists goes on! ','?'
'id: 71468 ',' I would like to have more options when it comes to the folder management but that  s what updates are for. ','?'
'id: 71480 ',' Works well just like the full version. ','?'
'id: 71482 ',' Please fix this!!!! ','?'
'id: 71483 ',' I LOVE the new update but  the push notifications need to be fixed, otherwise 5 stars!!? ','?'
'id: 71486 ',' I think everyone needs an account :) , ','?'
'id: 71507 ',' I just love all the school stuff and food ideas I am getting from pinterest. ','?'
'id: 71516 ',' Fully recommend it! ','?'
'id: 71518 ',' Fantastic app that lets you explore anything you  re truly interested in. ','?'
'id: 71525 ',' I think it  s ridiculous that you can  t email pins to people anymore, it makes using Pinterest irritating. ','?'
'id: 71527 ',' This app needs work it could be a great app but keeps closing itself out!! ','?'
'id: 71529 ',' I can get back on, but it would be nice if it didn  t close. ','?'
'id: 71552 ',' There are so many awesome things that you see, and if you need a home Remedy for something just search it an it will come up with at least 10+ things! ','?'
'id: 71553 ',' s Dojo ,  I can  t even sign up. ','?'
'id: 71558 ',' Also the comment section on a pin has no where for me to   post   the comment. ','?'
'id: 71563 ',' The makeup and hair ideas are terrific. ','?'
'id: 71564 ',' But having it at the tip of your fingertips is wonderful especially if you  re explaining a craft or something you saw on Pinterest you don  t have to print it out. ','?'
'id: 71565 ',' Not only is it the perfect app to waste the time away when you are waiting in line or can  t sleep but it is actually useful!!! ','?'
'id: 71566 ',' Pinterest is as useful as fun which is why it  s nice for someone to have it handy to help with many things or you have nothing to do at a given moment. ','?'
'id: 71573 ',' App needs a bit of work (like a   did it   button) but overall this is awesome!! ','?'
'id: 71578 ',' Now I only need to repin things and they are saved in my categories. ','?'
'id: 71583 ',' I love the variety of topics and items and creating my boards. ','?'
'id: 71587 ',' I would work on the save picture button because sometimes it doesn  t work and I have to completely exit out. ','?'
'id: 71589 ',' If you aren  t using this yet you are missing out. ','?'
'id: 71592 ',' Did it button would be a great idea or a way to provide feedback after you pinned , ','?'
'id: 71604 ',' Fun to see everything on here, but it crashes occasionally for no reason. ','?'
'id: 71608 ',' I love pinterest, but I just did the update and it crashes a lot and won  t let me see my likes. ','?'
'id: 71612 ',' I would like that if you want to add a pin to more than one board that you could just click on multiple ones instead of how it is currently having to add the pin manually to each board. ','?'
'id: 71618 ',' Sometimes the app crashes, but overall it works really well. ','?'
'id: 71628 ',' I love the improvements they have recently made! ','?'
'id: 71631 ',' It  s how I create my "Vision Boards". ','?'
'id: 71636 ',' You do not have to share all of your personal information; the website/app allows you to interact with people like you through the pictures and videos that you post, and that  s it! ','?'
'id: 71636 ',' You have a variety of people you can follow, and they only know what you are willing to put on the website/app. ','?'
'id: 71642 ',' Please fix this or tell me how to! ','?'
'id: 71652 ',' Could not have made it through planning a nursery or our house remodel without this app! ','?'
'id: 71655 ',' If you love arts and crafts and need ideas from time to time, this is the app for you! ','?'
'id: 71663 ',' Then we see how we can change what we  ve seen and create our own cards using our own style. ','?'
'id: 71673 ',' The only thing I  m missing is I wish there was a way to change your board covers from the app. ','?'
'id: 71685 ',' Pinterest is awesome and I love that it  s available on my phone , ','?'
'id: 71691 ',' Love this app can  t get enough! ','?'

'id: 71720 ',' I love the idea of Pinterest, but there does seem to be some bugs to be worked out. ','?'
'id: 71720 ',' Hopefully, these are problems that can be fixed. ','?'
'id: 71720 ',' It is a great concept, just has a way to go to get things humming along really well. ','?'
'id: 71721 ',' I loved how you could close the initial window by the swish of my thumb and was sad that it is gone now :( , ','?'
'id: 71722 ',' Be aware you will spend hours on this site! ','?'
'id: 71723 ',' Please make the ipad version like the iPhone version! ','?'
'id: 71724 ',' This has only been an issue since the new update. ','?'
'id: 71725 ',' Great app...when I first got it the app crashed lots but that rarely happens now. ','?'
'id: 71725 ',' Once you try out whatever you pin you can edit &amp; say whether or not it turned out well. ','?'
'id: 71735 ',' \\nBut I would like to see more on horses, tame &amp; wild. ','?'
'id: 71741 ',' Just love  this app !! ','?'
'id: 71759 ',' It has a variety of different sections, whether your a tech guru or history buff; want a little humor or you want to know how to get those dang azaleas to grow in your front yard, Pinterest is the place to look! ','?'
'id: 71760 ',' This app needs a lot of tweaking before it will be as good as the actual site. ','?'
'id: 71766 ',' If that one problem could be fixed it would be perfect!!!! ','?'
'id: 71768 ',' I have made a few dishes this past week. ','?'
'id: 71781 ',' I never have any problems with Pinterest on my phone! ','?'
'id: 71781 ',' The only problem I have is when I  m using it on my iPad in safari, sometimes I can  t scroll to the board I want. ','?'

'id: 71809 ',' Highly recommended app. ','?'
'id: 71814 ',' I wish this could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 71832 ',' Though I do wish there is a "did it" button (not my idea I saw it mentioned in another review) it would be nice to show people how it turned out. ','?'
'id: 71835 ',' I wish there was some way to get notified if you  ve already pinned something, but not sure if there  s a way to do that. ','?'

'id: 71850 ',' If you want to know how to do something, anything, Pinterest can help!!!! ','?'

'id: 71863 ',' Glitches need fixed ASAP. ','?'
'id: 71865 ',' Also I like what another reviewer suggested with the "did it" option, it would be cool to see others completed works as well as post my own. ','?'
'id: 71866 ',' It  s like an app library full of things to learn and have access to later when you need them. ','?'
'id: 71885 ',' I also like that the recently pinned boards are available for quick access. ','?'
'id: 71890 ',' It would be nice if there was a search bar on the followers/following page to look up people you follow quickly. ','?'
'id: 71900 ',' What can you not love about this app!!!? ','?'
'id: 71915 ',' I just LOVE it!!! ','?'
'id: 71919 ',' Can  t stop searching, scrolling, reading!!!!! ','?'
'id: 71935 ',' I think I like it better than the online one because it has suggested pins which are really easy to find and move around in without loosing your place. ','?'
'id: 71957 ',' Recent version seems to have fixed the issues I had previously. ','?'
'id: 71959 ',' It took me a minute to figure out how to use the app but I love it now!! ','?'
'id: 71962 ',' I use it all the time   everything I need can be found on Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 71976 ',' I highly recommend it to anyone out there! ','?'
'id: 71976 ',' It would be great if there was a part of the pin to check off once you tried the recipe or did what you wanted to with the pin! ','?'
'id: 71986 ',' A lot of fun, used to crash a lot but I think that  s fixed now. ','?'
'id: 71993 ',' The one problem I have is that it crashes when I try to move pins from one board to another. ','?'
'id: 72003 ',' I just love this site . ','?'
'id: 72003 ',' It is very interesting and good ideas. ','?'
'id: 72008 ',' All the things I have wanted to do, didn  t know how to do or never dreamed of doing, are right here, literally at my finger tips! ','?'
'id: 72022 ',' I wish you could go through pins easier instead of clicking on one and going back to see the next one. ','?'
'id: 72048 ',' For example, I know I pinned a certain recipe, but I have to scroll through hundreds of my pins until I find it. ','?'
'id: 72060 ',' Just love it. ','?'
'id: 72063 ',' Don  t want to pass on recipes, ideas that really need to be put to rest. ','?'
'id: 72068 ',' I would also like to see a tried it button that would allow you to add comments about things you  ve tried. ','?'
'id: 72069 ',' June 2   evidently, a recent update requires approval to allow Pinterest access to personal FB data when linking to Pin from a FB post. ','?'
'id: 72069 ',' \\n\\nSince 5/13 update, app crashes when transferring from FB to Pin on iPhone 4. ','?'
'id: 72071 ',' Quest 3737 ,  Also wish you could limit certain people from finding you , ','?'
'id: 72085 ',' Tends to crash frequently, but not sure if the issue is my iPod or the app. ','?'
'id: 72093 ',' One of the best apps you could ever download!! ','?'
'id: 72099 ',' I agree with a previous reviewer that Pinterest should add a "did it" button or column, etc. ','?'
'id: 72099 ',' \\n\\nI haven  t had any problems with the ap on my phone. ','?'
'id: 72107 ',' My friend Jillian got me hooked on Pinterest and I must say it is a great thing. ','?'
'id: 72107 ',' You name it, it is here. ','?'
'id: 72112 ',' I love this app I have to time myself on it,because it is so addicting. ','?'
'id: 72127 ',' I agree with another writer....you need a "I DID IT" button. ','?'
'id: 72129 ',' I only wish that pins that no longer have the blog or tutorial attached would be removed. ','?'
'id: 72129 ',' So annoying when you have to go through so many screens only to be told the information you  re looking for is no longer available. ','?'
'id: 72130 ',' Still love it, still ADDICTING, so inspiring..........but the app constantly crashes on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 72153 ',' Sometimes doesn  t let me post pins, gives error message but other than that it  s great! ','?'
'id: 72154 ',' But it closes unexpectedly for no reason sometimes that could be improved. ','?'
'id: 72157 ',' I wish there was a way to refine your search for a specific group instead of all of Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 72169 ',' There is always room for improvement  some of the largest fixes I would suggest: ability to search within my own boards. ','?'
'id: 72170 ',' The side bar will pop out, or it will randomly take me back to the home page, or crash all together. ','?'
'id: 72170 ',' I highly recommend it to everyone! ','?'
'id: 72176 ',' OHEMGEE I live this app so much there  s soooo many things to choose from things that I had no idea that was even on there is there wheeee I am soo amazed with this app!!! ','?'
'id: 72181 ',' Like I said previously, good app if you need to kill sometime before an appointment or meeting. ','?'
'id: 72181 ',' good app if you need to kill about 30 minutes waiting for someone or something. ','?'
'id: 72181 ',' Crashes, freezes, Can Not Load Data, issues are a constant! ','?'
'id: 72181 ',' Hope they are able to fix these issues since Pintrest is a good app to use when you are bored or have a wait for an appointment or meeting. ','?'
'id: 72192 ',' I love pinterest but I think we should be able to pin more than one photo at a time. ','?'
'id: 72194 ',' The many inspirational sayings/quotes and gardening ideas are just fun and encouraging. ','?'
'id: 72195 ',' \\nMy only problem is that when I try to save a photo to my camera roll it sometimes freezes or crashes, so please fix that! ','?'
'id: 72199 ',' Works great, I have not had any problems with this app!! ','?'
'id: 72212 ',' I  ve never had a problem with the functioning I this app and its super easy to navigate through. ','?'
'id: 72225 ',' It  s a great idea and works well! ','?'
'id: 72228 ',' I am also having a horrible time moving my boards, I use to drag and drop and then lock changes, since you reformatted it that unlock and format option has been removed by simply drag and drop without having to unlock and lock formatting. ','?'
'id: 72232 ',' Haven  t had any problems using this app. ','?'
'id: 72242 ',' I want to know how to edit board covers on the pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 72242 ',' Please make this available to the pinterest app also. ','?'
'id: 72244 ',' I think this is a great app it works there is no problems and it is pretty cool , ','?'
'id: 72246 ',' I had to delete and reinstall this app because it was taking up TWO AND A HALF GIGS on my phone. ','?'
'id: 72247 ',' Pretty sure the next to last update crashed my iPad. ','?'
'id: 72247 ',' Wish there was a way to sort in each category so you could ignore certain pins   nail art, wedding gowns, etc. ','?'
'id: 72250 ',' I love that you can easily view all your boards and that the pictures are big so you can see what you want. ','?'
'id: 72257 ',' Everything you could ever think of is here. ','?'
'id: 72286 ',' Although there are a few small problems most are unnoticeable and don  t heavily affect you. ','?'
'id: 72287 ',' If a pin says "how to" or "do it yourself" I expect to be directed to a link that has the steps, not just a picture from tumbler. ','?'
'id: 72299 ',' I can  t stop looking. ','?'
'id: 72300 ',' There are a few issues but it is getting better! ','?'
'id: 72304 ',' I think that the app is great I love all of the recipes and wedding ideas but it freezes a lot, websites are usually not available or labeled as spam and the app just shuts down at times. ','?'
'id: 72304 ',' Major issue is the fact that the page won  t rotate on the iPhone....other than that I love it , ','?'
'id: 72311 ',' "Something from the grill, but first let be pin and read all the pins about cleaning the grill, how to efficiently light it, whether I should use charcoal or gas, etc. ','?'
'id: 72317 ',' I think I may need Pinterest rehab! ','?'
'id: 72319 ',' \\n\\nPinterest needs to find a way to get around that or a lot of users are going to bail. ','?'
'id: 72338 ',' I have not had any problems with this ap either on my iPad or iPhone. ','?'
'id: 72338 ',' The only "problem" I have is the hours that seem to pass unnoticed while I am on this ap. ','?'
'id: 72338 ',' how did I live ever without it? ','?'
'id: 72344 ',' WHY, oh why can  t this app work more smoothly? ','?'
'id: 72346 ',' It  s right where I posted it when I need to refer to it! ','?'
'id: 72347 ',' This app is perfect for pinning on the go and provides a super easy reference when you want to recreate that recipe or project you pinned weeks ago. ','?'
'id: 72358 ',' For example, I like to pin my travel stuff chronologically, and if I find a pin for a place long after I ve pined a bunch of other tuff, it would be nice to be able to move it to a cluster of like pins. ','?'
'id: 72359 ',' So addicted I need to go to a meeting about it! ','?'
'id: 72369 ',' My only complaint is that the current iPad app crashes my iPad every time. ','?'
'id: 72375 ',' The app works great and has improved a great deal through time, but to get that last star it really needs a bulk editing tool and better customer support! ','?'
'id: 72381 ',' I wish you could create sub folders. ','?'
'id: 72388 ',' Iphone app crashes occasionally but the new updates are great! ','?'
'id: 72388 ',' It recognizes if you accidentally post the same thing twice and the similar posts at the bottom are awesome. ','?'
'id: 72392 ',' \\nSeriously, you can swipe downward on your mobile device forever and the pins just keep coming. ','?'
'id: 72397 ',' Only problem is it crashes sometimes , ','?'
'id: 72405 ',' There are a few issues. ','?'
'id: 72405 ',' It takes FOREVER because each time you have to reload the 400 pins you  ve already looked through. ','?'
'id: 72410 ',' So many wonderful ideas, pics that are so Beautiful, and ideas that are great! ','?'
'id: 72413 ',' I can  t stop xD , ','?'
'id: 72421 ',' I love that you can have your boards and pins with you, and available to you wherever you go. ','?'
'id: 72432 ',' You can find ideas on how to do anything!! ','?'
'id: 72456 ',' Just link it through the app , ','?'
'id: 72467 ',' If I need help or an idea it  s the first place I go. ','?'
'id: 72476 ',' The key is that you can upload your own pins. ','?'
'id: 72477 ',' I have never had a problem with this app and find it a great tool when I am in the craft store and know that I have forgotten something but cannot remember what exactly , ','?'
'id: 72488 ',' Do not use much more....crashes. ','?'
'id: 72488 ',' Also, pin removed from private board as inappropriate and I don  t know what the issue was. ','?'
'id: 72490 ',' The only problem would be that it doesn  t always save item I   liked  , but other than I would recommend it. ','?'
'id: 72492 ',' I can  t pin without my blood pressure going up! ','?'
'id: 72497 ',' Love the idea of this app but it crashes constantly. ','?'
'id: 72507 ',' The latest update made significant improvements to the UI and stability of the app. ','?'
'id: 72510 ',' I check Pinterest for solutions to common problems (IE: How to clean crayon from walls), and I check it for motivation and inspiration!!! ','?'
'id: 72511 ',' What did we do without Pinterest before? ','?'
'id: 72520 ',' Or maybe it does and I haven  t seen how to do it. ','?'
'id: 72527 ',' Lately the app has been crashing a lot and I really don  t like the new layout for picking a board. ','?'
'id: 72535 ',' This is a great app except for it crashes on occasion. ','?'
'id: 72536 ',' JLD773 ,  The first 5   6 pictures load fine then after that I don  t get the pictures just the text on the pins. ','?'
'id: 72536 ',' So please fix this. ','?'
'id: 72562 ',' Definitely recommend it. ','?'
'id: 72568 ',' Don  t have the crashing problem that others have. ','?'
'id: 72575 ',' There are so many good ideas. ','?'
'id: 72577 ',' I have created so many things and learned so much with this app. ','?'
'id: 72592 ',' I seriously have a problem ! ','?'
'id: 72607 ',' What happened to my scroll to top? ','?'
'id: 72607 ',' Please put it back. ','?'
'id: 72613 ',' My only complaint with this app is that once I get started, I just can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 72625 ',' Would love if there was a pin button available on my phone, but other than that great! ','?'
'id: 72634 ',' Since its just failing on my one device I  ve reinstalled thinking that would solve the issue sadly no go. ','?'
'id: 72634 ',' Please fix what ever is going on that prevents it from working on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 72638 ',' Bugs:  it "crashes" every once in awhile and spontaneously closes the app and then it "freezes" other times and you have to manually close the app. ','?'
'id: 72652 ',' I  d definitely recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 72662 ',' Has really good info and all types of tips and how to videos. ','?'
'id: 72668 ',' Meb233 ,  Great ideas are buried in here....just don  t let yourself get too consumed! ','?'
'id: 72669 ',' I can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 72676 ',' Only complaint is that there is an issue when I go from my suggested pins in my email to Pinterest?!?! ','?'
'id: 72677 ',' I love how I can look up my latest pinned recipes while I  m shopping or just browse the site in an easy to see format! ','?'
'id: 72679 ',' I wish there was a way to block all cupcake recipes from my home page. ','?'
'id: 72701 ',' The only down fall I found is you can  t refresh the page. ','?'
'id: 72706 ',' Highly recommend it to anyone. ','?'
'id: 72707 ',' I love Pinterest and this app, but I really wish the search function were better, that you could search within categories and just have more options. ','?'
'id: 72714 ',' Works smoothly and they finally added push notifications. ','?'
'id: 72715 ',' Would be nice to know if the comments are from the original pinner or repinner though. ','?'
'id: 72722 ',' The only thing that would make the ipad app better is if it could have the same "like" set up as the iPhone app where the like is right in the pictures as you  re scrolling thru instead of having to click first and then like. ','?'
'id: 72726 ',' This app has provided me so many ideas that I have shared with others. ','?'
'id: 72745 ',' I love it, but when I find a pin I want to know more about, it randomly pops me out. ','?'
'id: 72752 ',' I only wish that the pictures could be zoomed on to take a closer look or to read the print. ','?'
'id: 72756 ',' Never fails. ','?'
'id: 72765 ',' Ladies love it and can spend hours pinning all the stuff they want to have, do and eat ;) Once you start, you can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 72771 ',' Awesome app....if I could only have 1 app, this would be my choice. ','?'
'id: 72778 ',' I have a problem with this app. ','?'

'id: 72949 ',' Can  t tell you how many hours of my life I  ve frittered away on this darn app, but they  re completely worth it! ','?'

'id: 74895 ',' But what is this new   scroll down to see related pins   thing? ','?'
'id: 74895 ',' If someone can  t figure out how to scroll down without you telling them then they probably wouldn  t have been clever enough to figure out how to have the app to begin with. ','?'
'id: 74897 ',' Plus, now I have to make so much crap now because thee ol ball and chain thinks that everything on here is just so freaking simple to make. ','?'

'id: 75779 ',' Overall, the app works good, crashed periodically, but rare\\n\\nMy biggest issue is that you click a pin to see it better and then a second later a box pops up that blocks what you were reading on the pin. ','?'

'id: 75843 ',' But I wish you could unpin items. ','?'
'id: 75850 ',' I can  t think of anything I don  t like about Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 75859 ',' Upgrades have improved operation a lot, but I would like to see some type of trigger added to keep multiples of the same pins from showing over and over. ','?'
'id: 75870 ',' Why would you block viewing a larger picture? ','?'
'id: 75870 ',' Please please please delete this so I can give you 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 75872 ',' There are sooo many great ideas i wish i cld do them all!! ','?'
'id: 75880 ',' You need to change this. ','?'
'id: 75897 ',' Putting a pin just on one board is not very flexible. ','?'

'id: 75959 ',' I spent over an 2 hours trying to figure out how to fix it. ','?'
'id: 75959 ',' The features are amazing but their tech team needs to fix the coding. ','?'
'id: 75966 ',' You don  t need me to say it but they keep asking me to. ','?'
'id: 75969 ',' Now if I just had enough time to make/do/or buy all the cool things I have pinned. ','?'

'id: 76069 ',' When I  m trying to pin something and then it crashes, I usually can  t recover the pin!!!!! ','?'
'id: 76084 ',' I wish there was an easier way to edit and organize boards and a feature to tell you if you already pinned something. ','?'
'id: 76089 ',' What could be better? ','?'
'id: 76093 ',' I cannot even tell you how much. ','?'
'id: 76093 ',' And then you have to start at square one. ','?'
'id: 76093 ',' It would be better if the only way to get rid of the page would be to close it. ','?'
'id: 76093 ',' Just recently, when I go to repin the description box info that  s filled with someone  s previous description it  s all the way to the left of the box (so it can  t be read ) so I have to delete until the blinking bar stops. ','?'
'id: 76093 ',' What has happened? ','?'
'id: 76093 ',' Never used to have this issue. ','?'
'id: 76094 ',' You can  t tag people with the app as you can on a computer otherwise it  s awesome. ','?'
'id: 76107 ',' Like the concept of Pinterest, but it frequently shuts down when I am trying to repin an item to my board. ','?'
'id: 76108 ',' I can use it for all sorts of stuff like getting fit and in shape, or hair styles and make up tricks, and redesigning my house, and I can also keep track of articles I read on the Internet by pinning them. ','?'
'id: 76109 ',' Love, love, love, just wish there was a way to "clean up" your boards, I  ve accidentally pinned things to the wrong board. ','?'
'id: 76109 ',' Lol it would be nice to manage that better. ','?'
'id: 76117 ',' I am so happy they switched and you don  t need Facebook to sign up. ','?'
'id: 76123 ',' Love if you need a idea for supper..just a click away. ','?'
'id: 76141 ',' I love this app, the only problem is that I can  t seem to spend less than an hour a day on it. ','?'
'id: 76159 ',' Please provide a roll back to previous version option. ','?'
'id: 76159 ',' Please provide a way to opt out of it. ','?'
'id: 76161 ',' Completely addicted and absolutely love this forum for things, but would be nice for the phone app if you could re arrange your boards and change cover pics. ','?'
'id: 76163 ',' But app should have long pin it button at bottom when repinning something so both left And right handers can Repin with just one hand easier. ','?'
'id: 76165 ',' Only issue is I wish there was a way to search your boards more easily! ','?'
'id: 76176 ',' Like it better then just using my browser on the I pad but it crashes tons for me I can pin two or three things and then I have to open in it back up and start over. ','?'
'id: 76176 ',' Sometimes it just shows the headers and no pictures and I have to get off for awhile and try again but this is still my preferred method for pinterest on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 76183 ',' How did I live without it? ','?'
'id: 76194 ',' My only problem is that annoying black box that pops up and says scroll down for more pins. ','?'
'id: 76217 ',' I can  t image there could be anyone, female or male, who couldn  t find something to love here. ','?'

'id: 76238 ',' I am getting rid of all my cookbooks because all,the recipes I could ever want are here. ','?'
'id: 76241 ',' It has more categories than the website and I love that you can have more than one board open at once and swap between them. ','?'
'id: 76255 ',' I now know how to make a Star Wars AT AT Bunk Bed!!! ','?'
'id: 76277 ',' The iPad app does close sometimes and does have some minor glitches but nothing you can  t work around. ','?'
'id: 76296 ',' Only reason I didn  t give it 5 stars is because when you find something that you want to buy, it is often no longer available for purchase. ','?'
'id: 76299 ',' \\nEvery one that lives these things needs this app , ','?'
'id: 76306 ',' I like but it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 76320 ',' Do wish you could search within your own pins for what your searching for like a recipe. ','?'
'id: 76330 ',' It opens your eyes to some great ideas that you may not have thought of yourself. ','?'
'id: 76330 ',' \\n\\n**The only issue is each category only lists about 40 pins and won  t load anymore. ','?'
'id: 76341 ',' Website is great but think it is stupid that it is acting like a Facebook with the fact that you can "block" people!!! ','?'
'id: 76343 ',' ,  I love this app, but it needs the ability to change text size. ','?'
'id: 76359 ',' This is the place to go to fill my inner cup when it needs a taste of beauty, inspiration, and a dash of hopes and dreams. ','?'
'id: 76359 ',' I highly recommend it. ','?'

'id: 76411 ',' I can no longer upload my own pins by adding a link. ','?'
'id: 76411 ',' I have tried adding the bookmarklet per Pinterest instructions and it hasn  t worked. ','?'
'id: 76411 ',' These  seem to be things that should have been considered before rolling out the new version. ','?'
'id: 76413 ',' Awesome, addictive, can  t stop pinning!!! ','?'
'id: 76430 ',' Pinterest has so many wonderful ideas, some I  ve tried and others I can  t wait to try. ','?'

'id: 76503 ',' However, now there is an ANNOYING arrow right in the middle of the picture so you cannot see it. ','?'
'id: 76503 ',' You have to go to the website in order to see the picture or recipe without the arrow. ','?'
'id: 76511 ',' This app is fantastic I have all I need right at my fingertips. ','?'
'id: 76527 ',' Which brainless wonder thought that was a good idea? ','?'
'id: 76538 ',' Please Please Fix Soon!! ','?'
'id: 76542 ',' I can quickly access my boards while I  m getting ready to get ideas on how to do my hair...and that  s just one awesome way I use it! ','?'
'id: 76558 ',' I can use it at the store if I can  t remember what goes in a recipe. ','?'
'id: 76560 ',' But just get the app it  s amazing , ','?'
'id: 76567 ',' Please make an "I did it!" ','?'
'id: 76587 ',' I think everyone should download it!!!!! ','?'
'id: 76588 ',' I love Pinterest, but sometimes it  s really slow and sometimes it will just close on me. ','?'
'id: 76596 ',' I would still rather use everything from a normal computer, but as far as this app is concerned I think it works just fine. ','?'
'id: 76632 ',' I have by far made a few thousands and it feels great too. ','?'
'id: 76632 ',' Download the app try it yourself and type in "liibii1992" as the person who referred you and receive $2.50 (250 points) just for signing up. ','?'
'id: 76642 ',' Haven  t had a problem! ','?'
'id: 76645 ',' This app has come a long way, the iPad one needs an update to be like the iPhone one though. ','?'
'id: 76653 ',' Just a problem that it often crashes and that is very annoying. ','?'
'id: 76655 ',' Only wish there was a way to comment on things after you  ve made them/done them so others could know what you thought. ','?'
'id: 76658 ',' The only issue is the site constantly crashes. ','?'
'id: 76664 ',' I find what I need! ','?'
'id: 76705 ',' I don  t suggest getting it If you don  t wanna get utterly addicted ! ','?'
'id: 76711 ',' Easy to use and find everything I need! ','?'

'id: 76777 ',' Ease get rid of it or at least tell me how to get rid of it if possible. ','?'
'id: 76781 ',' I am having issues now that I updated because after I click on the article, the scroll down to see more pins like this one pops up and I can  t see the item I wanted to look at. ','?'
'id: 76789 ',' As aggravating as it is to not have it when I need it, it  s usually not a huge problem and works fine. ','?'
'id: 76793 ',' 1day I was on it for a couple of hrs.thanks so much to whomever created this site. ','?'
'id: 76800 ',' App crashes a lot, especially when loading big images. ','?'

'id: 76827 ',' But app crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 76828 ',' I have to log in once a week to search and get ideas on the topics i love most, and I just love the email updates. ','?'
'id: 76833 ',' Some of our boards have thousands of pins and it is difficult to find a specific pin that may have been pinned quite a while back. ','?'
'id: 76837 ',' Do not have to do that in iPhone ap. ','?'
'id: 76837 ',' That just stinks!!! ','?'
'id: 76851 ',' App still crashes. ','?'
'id: 76853 ',' Only problem is how addicting it is, and the lack of sleep that goes along with that!! ','?'
'id: 76856 ',' This is an amazing app that you can find tons of new things to enhance your life. ','?'
'id: 76860 ',' Maybe I just don  t get it. ','?'
'id: 76860 ',' Like the ideas but can  t get recipes, can  t pin it. ','?'
'id: 76860 ',' Maybe I just don  t understand how to work , ','?'
'id: 76862 ',' just love this lots of ideas , ','?'
'id: 76863 ',' Also, every time I open the app on my iPad 2 it tells me that my login failed and would I like to try again. ','?'
'id: 76869 ',' Please make this arrow go away! ','?'
'id: 76876 ',' I never have any problems with it! ','?'
'id: 76884 ',' How would I have time to utilize this wonderful site if I was still working! ','?'
'id: 76885 ',' It would be nice to not keep seeing what you have already pinned. ','?'
'id: 76897 ',' I absolutely love it, and DEF recommend it!! ','?'
'id: 76913 ',' Why does the "Scroll down to see related pins" block the pin you WANT to see? ','?'
'id: 76919 ',' that  s all that needs to be said , ','?'
'id: 76920 ',' Best way to use Pinterest is with the app on the iPad. ','?'
'id: 76924 ',' It would be nice if this app automatically started at the top, with the newest pins. ','?'
'id: 76933 ',' I am on it almost everyday, the ideas are endless. ','?'
'id: 76934 ',' I don  t know where I  d be without my Pinterest App, I can use it anytime I want!!! ','?'
'id: 76938 ',' I am planning my wedding, and I don  t know what I would do without it! ','?'
'id: 76941 ',' I previously enjoyed Pinterest but now suffer through it because of the annoying "See related pins below" that pops up when I  m looking at a pin. ','?'
'id: 76972 ',' I also love that on your iPhone you can double tap the pin and automatically routes you to the pinned website , ','?'
'id: 76981 ',' The only problem is that it does crash often. ','?'
'id: 76981 ',' I have no issue with the site itself, but the app can be a bit frustrating. ','?'
'id: 76985 ',' Why can  t we save to favorites for future reference ?? ','?'
'id: 76985 ',' New version has bugs and loads SO slowly on the IPad. ','?'
'id: 76987 ',' It helps me cope with the fact I can  t shop all the time! ','?'
'id: 76992 ',' Why do I have to write 6000 words? ','?'
'id: 76996 ',' Lots of fun, never gets boring, but app crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 76999 ',' Be warned you could spend days lost on Pinterest getting inspired. ','?'
'id: 77005 ',' I wish there was a way to automatically reduce double/triple pinning...or a faster way to reorganize pins to new boards. ','?'
'id: 77014 ',' I love this app, I would rather use my Pinterest app on my phone rather than the computer. ','?'
'id: 77025 ',' Can you fix the bug that makes it freeze when we try to save a certain picture? ','?'
'id: 77026 ',' I love all the ideas that are here I have found them very useful , ','?'
'id: 77048 ',' Only problem on my iPad is that after a while, it closes even when I  m trying to repin things so it  s a little buggy. ','?'
'id: 77048 ',' This might be an iPad issue. ','?'
'id: 77052 ',' App is good...crashes during busy times, and there seems to be a problem with pornography being in strange searches , ','?'
'id: 77055 ',' I have not had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 77065 ',' The only problem with the program is that certain punctuation does not translate properly in the comment box. ','?'
'id: 77076 ',' Stop adding "features" that no one wants (like silly the show more arrow everyone is ranting about) and take some extra time on making your app fully compatible with all devices running 5.1 and up...as you claim you already do! ','?'
'id: 77086 ',' It requires the Internet and does not work without it. ','?'
'id: 77113 ',' I have been working on losing weight and whenever I need motivation or good ideas, I can always check out pinterest and can always get something to help me out. ','?'
'id: 77125 ',' Please eliminate this feature. ','?'
'id: 77125 ',' It really spoils the experience you have created. ','?'
'id: 77129 ',' It  s like a giant magazine for every subject you want to know about. ','?'
'id: 77129 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 77130 ',' It taps into every aspect of your life whether you  re needing great workouts,recipes,home and garden ,DIY or fashion tips etc.,etc.. ','?'
'id: 77131 ',' Helping my sister in law planning her wedding and the ideas are incredible! ','?'

'id: 77138 ',' Fashion, hair, makeup, crafting, home decor, sewing, cooking, gardening, and I  m sure there is all kinds of stuff for men too, I just don  t look for it , ','?'
'id: 77141 ',' But now I can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 77155 ',' Such a great app for long lines or anything you have to wait for, I can spend hours on this app! ','?'
'id: 77158 ',' Now I can use it when I  m out and about as well. ','?'
'id: 77165 ',' The only problem with Pinterest is that it is addictive! ','?'
'id: 77168 ',' I just downloaded the app a couple of weeks ago, but I  m loving it so far! ','?'
'id: 77173 ',' I  ve had this app for a long time,but since the new update they  ve added this nagging little pop up that I would love to see gone!!!! ','?'
'id: 77179 ',' I just love it!! ','?'
'id: 77190 ',' I love to pin, I love to try, I love to post!!! ','?'

'id: 77195 ',' But it crashes all the time on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 77195 ',' I feel like something  s missing , ','?'
'id: 77200 ',' How did I ever do it without Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 77213 ',' Plus on the iPhone you don  t have a way to pin from websites...unless I just haven  t been able to figure that out yet. ','?'
'id: 77236 ',' Everyone should have a Pinterest board! ','?'
'id: 77237 ',' I pin the sauce afterward, but I may never use it again because there  s just too much good stuff out there to try! ','?'
'id: 77240 ',' Very helpful with most anything you need!!! ','?'
'id: 77243 ',' Doesn  t seem to have any bugs. ','?'
'id: 77253 ',' It helped me plan my life!! ','?'
'id: 77265 ',' I really just enjoy all of it. ','?'
'id: 77269 ',' I am very glad I did because looking through the different boards, and creating my own, has been a enormous stress reliever on days when I need to mentally disconnect from work &amp; other task. ','?'
'id: 77276 ',' It seems that when I need an idea for just about anything I just turn to Pinterest and there it is! ','?'
'id: 77296 ',' Just bought a home and Pinterest is helping me with decor ideas. ','?'
'id: 77301 ',' What is the point of this? ','?'
'id: 77301 ',' I wish there was a way to at least close it. ','?'
'id: 77310 ',' Then it  s so easy to find my favorite things again when I need them for real life! ','?'
'id: 77320 ',' I love Pinterest but it will kick me out at times or doesn  t let me access my pins, it will say not available. ','?'
'id: 77329 ',' Only problem is you start looking at things and an hour can easily pass before you know it. ','?'
'id: 77340 ',' So addicting and a perfect app/site to have handy when you have a couple moments in between things or just need some inspiration. ','?'
'id: 77346 ',' It  s a nice app but it crashes all the time for me. ','?'
'id: 77371 ',' I can  t stop pinning! ','?'
'id: 77398 ',' Everything and anything is here , ','?'
'id: 77399 ',' The best place to go when you are bored and you need some crafting to do. ','?'
'id: 77402 ',' For a while it wasn  t saving pictures properly but it seems that bug has been fixed. ','?'
'id: 77404 ',' This app is easy to use and I just love it. ','?'
'id: 77412 ',' I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 77413 ',' Fairly easy to use, could have better instructions on how to save Pins. ','?'
'id: 77416 ',' Someone said to give Pinterest a shot and now I  m hooked! ','?'
'id: 77418 ',' Don  t ever have any problems , ','?'
'id: 77420 ',' Great when you need some ideas. ','?'
'id: 77423 ',' I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 77426 ',' Pinterest needs a search engine to specifically search topics, such as "outer space birthday". ','?'
'id: 77429 ',' What happened? ','?'
'id: 77432 ',' However there is bugs! ','?'
'id: 77463 ',' Pinterest has solved that for me and made an easy way to organize my ideas for future and current endeavors. ','?'
'id: 77471 ',' If you want a recipe or "how to" directions it is on Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 77482 ',' The only issue I have is with the iPhone app. ','?'
'id: 77493 ',' I would love something like this just as you have the Pin bookmarklet on the computer. ','?'
'id: 77493 ',' I just don  t like the spam I used to get but I think you guys fixed that as I get more real ideas from searches rather than the same photo over and over again with no content. ','?'
'id: 77502 ',' the app needs some work. ','?'
'id: 77514 ',' My only problem is that is crashes occasionally I couldn  t stand to give it any less than 5 stars!! ','?'
'id: 77525 ',' Now they need to have support groups for all of us who r addicted to pintrest. ','?'
'id: 77526 ',' Only thing that would make it better is if we like a recipe we could add it to a recipe card &amp; print it later. ','?'
'id: 77526 ',' This way they are all universal &amp; stored for us. ','?'
'id: 77538 ',' Absolutely love this app, however, frustrating when the app crashes and you have to start from the top when your searching a category. ','?'
'id: 77551 ',' How do you correct this? ','?'
'id: 77554 ',' Sometimes I wish I new more on how to get certain things posted and how to make up some posts that have not already been pinned by someone else. ','?'
'id: 77557 ',' How do you make Pinterest better? ','?'
'id: 77559 ',' I HIGHLY recommend at least a monthly delete and reinstall of the app until they address that issue. ','?'
'id: 77568 ',' I can find everything I want to know about using this app   from craft ideas, to recipes to child rearing tips, it  s all here! ','?'
'id: 77571 ',' Great app but it crashes a lot. ','?'

'id: 77585 ',' Just love Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 77588 ',' App could use some improvement. ','?'
'id: 77594 ',' Pinterest should have a warning label: Danger   Extremely addictive! ','?'
'id: 77594 ',' I can  t stop looking for new things to try. ','?'
'id: 77605 ',' Not only does it give you a convenient way to browse categories, it allows you to do everything that you can on the normal site, save upload. ','?'
'id: 77620 ',' I recommend it for everyone. ','?'
'id: 77643 ',' In the future I would like to see "sub category" boards. ','?'
'id: 77643 ',' For example, someone who has a "food/recipe" board can create sub category boards for "desserts" or "entrees." ','?'
'id: 77651 ',' Love all the great ideas and having a place to post and keep mine for future reference! ','?'

'id: 80113 ',' Maybe this will be fixed in future updates. ','?'
'id: 80125 ',' I just love Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 80126 ',' App seems to have fixed bugs that made it always force close , ','?'
'id: 80132 ',' Lately when I  ve used it though, the "see related pins below" box doesn  t go away when I  m looking at pins! ','?'
'id: 80141 ',' There are so many ideas. ','?'
'id: 80155 ',' I like all the ideas that you can share , ','?'
'id: 80161 ',' I love the ideas, inspirations and photos, but sometimes I have bugs and the app shut down without reason. ','?'
'id: 80170 ',' The problem is that this app caches data from your hundreds/thousands of pins and slowly begins to take up space on your phone, slowing it down and reducing the space for anything else. ','?'
'id: 80170 ',' My app was taking up almost 2gb of space on my phone and the only way to clear it up is to delete the app and redownload it. ','?'
'id: 80170 ',' Please fix this!! ','?'
'id: 80176 ',' I use it all the time and I never have problems with it! ','?'
'id: 80190 ',' The only thing the phone app can  t do is successfully tag people. ','?'
'id: 80191 ',' IPhone Version\\nThis needs landscape view and the ability to zoom in on photos. ','?'
'id: 80193 ',' I find the app lacking in that I need to create a pin it button in addition to installing the app in order to pin information from a website. ','?'
'id: 80193 ',' Seems like a functionality that could be enhanced. ','?'
'id: 80224 ',' That  s my only issue. ','?'
'id: 80233 ',' I love getting recipes and the humor, sometimes we just need a good laugh! ','?'
'id: 80245 ',' Now I can  t stop   really love the creativity of so many talented people :) , ','?'
'id: 80249 ',' Great app so is Pinterest only problem is it will sometimes close on its own with no warning and reset. ','?'
'id: 80281 ',' Great inspiration, easy to organize to use whenever you need it. ','?'
'id: 80302 ',' Great way to pinterest, except when I pin a lot, then the app tends to crash. ','?'
'id: 80326 ',' Great way to get new ideas as opposed to just using search engines. ','?'
'id: 80340 ',' I really like all of the pictures that you can look at! ','?'
'id: 80340 ',' This is really cool and great if you need an idea for different things! ','?'
'id: 80350 ',' I just wish you could somehow scroll your feed to the top by clicking on the red "Pinterest" logo instead of having to scroll up through every pin you  ve just looked at. ','?'
'id: 80354 ',' 10 minutes in Pinterest can easily turn into 3 hours.....unless your app crashes...crashes. ','?'
'id: 80358 ',' Why am I always on here? ','?'
'id: 80358 ',' Took me a minute on how to pronounce "Pinterest" but now I tell everyone. ','?'
'id: 80373 ',' Very easy to use, just like the site itself. ','?'
'id: 80379 ',' Now every time I use this app it crashes at some point; sometimes even after a mere 2 or 3 minutes of being open. ','?'
'id: 80389 ',' The only problem I have is once I login, I am addicted! ','?'
'id: 80399 ',' I would like to select a topic and Pinterest provides all of the possible searches. ','?'
'id: 80406 ',' The only problem is that it often turns off on my iPad, right in the middle of looking at a recipe! ','?'
'id: 80429 ',' I definitely recommend getting it. ','?'
'id: 80434 ',' It  s a great way to help my mom plan her wedding, and learn new and creative ideas! ','?'
'id: 80444 ',' You asked me to review, so here it is. ','?'
'id: 80444 ',' It crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 80444 ',' The iPhone app also crashes and sends error messages. ','?'

'id: 80452 ',' My only problem is it  s too addicting! ','?'
'id: 80460 ',' Daily timeouts and crashes. ','?'
'id: 80460 ',' You can  t go back to the spot you were at in a search when it crashed, so you lose whatever you found that you were trying to pin. ','?'

'id: 80473 ',' If I ever need to escape to somewhere I  ve never been, I know I can go there, get lost and no one will find me. ','?'
'id: 80475 ',' Only gripe is I can  t figure out how to add my own pics, etc without a blog of my own:( , ','?'
'id: 80476 ',' Just wish my screen was bigger. ','?'
'id: 80480 ',' Their pictures are so beautiful and you can fin how to do pretty much ANYTHING on there. ','?'
'id: 80492 ',' I thought of more categories that could be added. ','?'
'id: 80499 ',' I love that there are so many ideas! ','?'
'id: 80504 ',' It crashes often or I need to try several times before it will open. ','?'
'id: 80505 ',' It would be better if you could swipe through the enlarged pins instead of having to go back to the board in between looking at them. ','?'
'id: 80506 ',' Either way, it  s very addicting! ','?'
'id: 80507 ',' There are somethings I would like to see Improve though. ','?'
'id: 80515 ',' I just love it! ','?'
'id: 80520 ',' HollyCassaundra ,  Everything you need to make yourself, your home, your meals, and your kids FABULOUS! ','?'

'id: 80552 ',' So far I have learned how to eat and be healthy, got awesome decor ideas to my new apartment, and am learning a lot about history, thank you so much Pinterest pinners :) I recommend this app to everyone , ','?'
'id: 80556 ',' It takes for ever to load on my IPhone and it doesn  t show me what my friends on Facebook post. ','?'
'id: 80560 ',' I can lose track of time just pinning away!!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 80584 ',' Only complaint is that it crashes and sometimes is difficult to get to the website that the pin originates from. ','?'
'id: 80587 ',' I like that you can find information on most any subject. ','?'
'id: 80587 ',' You suggest a person who has posted the same picture or movie and boom it  s there. ','?'
'id: 80603 ',' Please change this. ','?'
'id: 80611 ',' I wish it would tell me what I  ve already pinned as I find myself repeating some things. ','?'
'id: 80616 ',' I really recommend this app to anyone of any age over 5 . ','?'
'id: 80620 ',' So far it  s been very addictive, entertaining, and a perfect place to go if you need an idea for anything! ','?'
'id: 80620 ',' I  m having a hard time figuring out how to have that permanently linked to any website I  click into. ','?'
'id: 80623 ',' It  s so easy to find what you  re looking for! ','?'
'id: 80625 ',' Hardly fails on me. ','?'
'id: 80639 ',' Only issue is that it crashes but then again so do most of my apps since my iPod touch is really old! ','?'
'id: 80645 ',' However it would be nice to be able to rearrange my boards in the order I use most to view later or have them in alphabetical order to be easier to find. ','?'
'id: 80658 ',' what else do you need? ','?'
'id: 80660 ',' Now I just need to find time to do them! ','?'
'id: 80661 ',' Plus, you can  t scroll down when you  re looking at a single pin, so it  s annoying(2). ','?'
'id: 80663 ',' I can  t stop pinteresting! ','?'
'id: 80665 ',' I do wish there was a way to reorganize the boards (delete pins, move pins to a different board, etc) that was simple. ','?'
'id: 80674 ',' My only problem is that it won  t let me upload from the Internet. ','?'
'id: 80679 ',' So many great ideas, this is one of my favorite apps! ','?'
'id: 80681 ',' Never have issues with it! ','?'
'id: 80687 ',' Very useful app for keeping up with what people post. ','?'

'id: 80693 ',' Everything I wanted to know &amp; more!!! ','?'
'id: 80700 ',' You now have to open the full pin where you  didn  t have to before. ','?'
'id: 80702 ',' Has minor issues sometimes, but overall, I recommend it. ','?'

'id: 80704 ',' I love this app just like the website! ','?'
'id: 80713 ',' I love this app and check it daily, however I just got the new update and there is one new feature that is going to drive me crazy! ','?'
'id: 80713 ',' Very annoying, please change it! ','?'
'id: 80714 ',' I know there is a way to share, just haven  t figured that out yet. ','?'
'id: 80716 ',' Just wish it didn  t take up so much space on my phone. ','?'
'id: 80731 ',' I have an iPhone 5, when I recently had the galaxy 3 this app worked great, perfect even, I  m always on it, but this one will stay stuck on a picture "downloading" for hours, and eventually it results in me having to delete and reinstall the app. ','?'
'id: 80731 ',' Please fix the glitches. ','?'
'id: 80750 ',' Only issue I have (and it could be user error and I just haven  t figured it out) is I can  t have a "pin it" button for my ipad. ','?'
'id: 80758 ',' Definitely a neat way to find things that you love that you weren  t even aware existed before. ','?'
'id: 80759 ',' The iPhone app has two problems though. ','?'
'id: 80759 ',' The last version before this didn  t have these problems. ','?'
'id: 80778 ',' But the app crashes a lot on my iPod. ','?'
'id: 80787 ',' Education and wedding planning has never been so easy/imaginative! ','?'
'id: 80789 ',' Giving it 5 stars even though it crashes on me from time to time on my iPhone4. ','?'

'id: 80798 ',' Please fix this ASAP! ','?'
'id: 80800 ',' You find all the best pictures ever here, you can also have secret boards and share them, or not , ','?'
'id: 80801 ',' Thanks to all that "pin"   please don  t stop. ','?'
'id: 80804 ',' The app is great, sometimes it crashes, but if you open it again it works. ','?'
'id: 80811 ',' just a little annoying to search for things because you can  t search categorically. ','?'
'id: 80813 ',' Lots of fun, but crashes sometimes. ','?'
'id: 80817 ',' I have a lot of fun just looking thru pins and get great ideas but it crashes all the time it makes me mad especially when in reading a pin , ','?'

'id: 80852 ',' What I was missing out on. ','?'
'id: 80853 ',' I love Pinterest but wish you could search sub categories under your search item , ','?'

'id: 80926 ',' I wish you could view the pins full screen like in the photo app and use the standard swipe motion to  scroll between pins. ','?'
'id: 80933 ',' If you ever need an idea for something I would suggest this app. ','?'
'id: 80961 ',' Everyone knows Pinterest can be addictive, well now you can browse anywhere. ','?'
'id: 80961 ',' Easy to use and when you click a pin, it brings up a nice big picture just like the site. ','?'
'id: 80961 ',' Repins are easy and the button to do so is easy to find, but adding your own original pins could use some improvement. ','?'

'id: 82249 ',' the only problems I  ve incurred, is that the App shuts itself off from time to time. ','?'
'id: 82249 ',' just needs to be more Useable, for PINNING !! ','?'
'id: 82250 ',' The ONLY thing that I suggest is for a way for us to search our own pages for a pin!! ','?'
'id: 82260 ',' There are not enough ways to show this app how much more interesting it has made my life! ','?'
'id: 82273 ',' I can create a board for everything I  m into. ','?'
'id: 82276 ',' I could spend all day on it no matter where I go &amp; some times I do because there are so many awesome ideas on there &amp; places to travel etc. ','?'
'id: 82299 ',' The only reason I didn  t give it 5 stars was because the app crashes usually once a day. ','?'
'id: 82300 ',' \\nWe need to communicate more through images. ','?'
'id: 82300 ',' We need to use our words to help the inages along. ','?'
'id: 82319 ',' My only complaint is that it occasionally crashes. ','?'
'id: 82330 ',' Great to use when you need an idea for almost anything! ','?'
'id: 82374 ',' \\nI would like to ask one thing, is there anyway to limit the reoccurrence of a pin when it is repinned? ','?'
'id: 82374 ',' I think I should see my repin on my board, but when you first search for something the pin should be there only once with the mention how many times it was repinned. ','?'
'id: 82380 ',' Site (and app) crash a lot. ','?'
'id: 82394 ',' Lil ,  Can  t stop pinning. ','?'
'id: 82396 ',' Pintrest is addictive to begin with and this iPad app just takes it to another level. ','?'
'id: 82400 ',' The app could use some attention, it is slow and crashes often. ','?'
'id: 82416 ',' You have to move each pin one by one to a new folder and then after movement go back to the pin to delete one by one. ','?'
'id: 82420 ',' My  "Go To" site, when I need an inspiration for literally anything! ','?'

'id: 82435 ',' I love Pinterest the only problem I have with this app is sometimes it decides just to not work for days! ','?'
'id: 82438 ',' you must try it to appreciate! ','?'
'id: 82452 ',' Haven  t had a problem yet. ','?'
'id: 82466 ',' I found that I was addicted pretty quickly but I noticed that the way some of the windows worked wasn  t making Pinterest easy to use and I could get   lost   pretty easily. ','?'
'id: 82466 ',' I  ve had an iPad for a couple of years and I love it but some of the apps that are designed to make a standard internet website work better on iOS just lose a lot of functionality. ','?'
'id: 82466 ',' If you love Pinterest you need this app. ','?'
'id: 82493 ',' It does crash fairly often, but that could be relative to hours spent on it. ','?'
'id: 82502 ',' Best app ever made!! ','?'
'id: 82504 ',' You have to check this app out especially if you have kids. ','?'
'id: 82511 ',' Pinterest is excellent but please please PLEASE add the ability to rotate with your iPad!! ','?'
'id: 82514 ',' Now I have all my pins ready with me, whenever I need to look up quickly a recipe, a swatch, an idea, etc. this app is excellent! ','?'
'id: 82540 ',' The only problem is that it crashes a lot , ','?'
'id: 82545 ',' \\n\\nI wish you didn  t have to scroll down for the back button because I keep hitting the website by mistake. ','?'
'id: 82545 ',' \\n\\nAlso, it would be cool to manage your board from an iPhone or iPad instead of the computer. ','?'
'id: 82547 ',' Devi1109 ,  Would normally rate at 5 stars, but I can  t  log in either! ','?'
'id: 82547 ',' Please fix it. ','?'

'id: 82610 ',' Glad I finally did, I  m a teacher and this is just what I need to organize ideas I find online. ','?'
'id: 82614 ',' Only problem is that it shuts down quite often. ','?'
'id: 82623 ',' If you decide to make changes or rearrange pictures it  s not easy especially since you can  t see all the pins on your boards . ','?'
'id: 82623 ',' You have to go the page that shows all you pins and hope they all show up there . ','?'
'id: 82630 ',' Love the app, BUT the iPad version constantly crashes. ','?'
'id: 82630 ',' (I don  t have the crashing problem with the iPhone version, but it would be nice to use the larger screen of the iPad.) ','?'
'id: 82638 ',' \\nThe only drawback is that the newest version means I have to click on a pin before I can select   like  . ','?'
'id: 82661 ',' I have pinned and used so many times that my phone requires me to clean out other storage to keep all my Pinterest stuff together!!!! ','?'

'id: 82710 ',' \\n  ie been struggling to figure out how to create new pins other than uploading a new photo as the app doesn  t communicate with any other apps. ','?'
'id: 82710 ',' If one pin is really long and requires a lot of scrolling, it takes an ridiculously long time to load, and slows down all the pins in the column next to it. ','?'
'id: 82713 ',' That should be put next on the programmers to do list or his cubicle wall. ','?'
'id: 82718 ',' I just wish the mobile version had the scroll to top button like the computer version has. ','?'

'id: 82763 ',' The only   glitch   I  ve noticed is sometimes the links to the pins fail to load or take u to some unrelated site. ','?'
'id: 82770 ',' It can be frustrating when you see something you want to know more about but the page doesn  t take you to the item. ','?'

'id: 82986 ',' Site/app is a very good idea. ','?'
'id: 82989 ',' I  m a crafty person but I usually need a little inspiration and Pinterest is so perfect for that. ','?'
'id: 82991 ',' I most DEFINANTLY suggest this! ','?'
'id: 82993 ',' Until Pinterest actually puts forth a little effort and acts on the hundreds, if not thousands of suggestions made by it  s pining community on how to "protect" those who see "art" through the narrowest, most fragile minded conservative eyes, don  t waste your time by rolling the dice on the hopes that what you view, and appreciate, as art or beauty does not fit the bill laid out by Pinterest and their kind. ','?'
'id: 83000 ',' Now that I have it on the go I can  t stop pinning! ','?'

'id: 83104 ',' Once you start you can  t stop!! ','?'
'id: 83105 ',' I highly recommend it!! ','?'
'id: 83121 ',' Love the new feature where you can see similar pins to what you just pin makes it even more addicting. ','?'
'id: 83121 ',' The only thing you need to add to the app is being able to select a board cover in app version. ','?'
'id: 83124 ',' There are some great ideas and it is nice to pin things (i.e. exercise or recipes) where you can easily find them. ','?'
'id: 83138 ',' It used to crash on me 90% of the time I used it but not anymore. ','?'
'id: 83141 ',' What did I do before Pinterest? ','?'

'id: 83209 ',' I just love this site I spend several hours a day on here. ','?'
'id: 83212 ',' Major complaint: the iphone app has closed or crashed on me multiple times. ','?'

'id: 83226 ',' This app really has it all you can even look up gamer ideas for your games. ','?'
'id: 83232 ',' I  d give it 5 stars if I could pin from my iPhone, so maybe you could work on that? ','?'
'id: 83232 ',' I love all the ideas I get from Pinterest, it  s a great thing! ','?'
'id: 83264 ',' Ya, the app has some glitches, but the concept is out of this world fulfilling to designer types who just need some pinsperation to get going on the next project. ','?'
'id: 83264 ',' I do wish I knew how to pin from the web on my phone. ','?'
'id: 83278 ',' I  m an occupational therapist and the ideas I got from this app are GREAT!!!! ','?'
'id: 83280 ',' The best place to go when you need new ideas or inspiration:) , ','?'
'id: 83299 ',' The mobile format could use some tune up, like being able to save photos to my phone. ','?'
'id: 83299 ',' Right now it  s crashing after I repin something. ','?'
'id: 83309 ',' When I post my own pictures, or even pin a nice picture, app blurs the image a bit. ','?'

'id: 83481 ',' Love Pinterest but the app needs work. ','?'
'id: 83481 ',' I  m not able to get on the full site much so I do expect a lot from the app but it leaves me wanting more. ','?'
'id: 83483 ',' LOVE the app, but do not like the new addition of, "Scroll down to vie related pins" that appears when looking at a pin. ','?'
'id: 83492 ',' It  s a good app, but it tends to crash sometimes. ','?'
'id: 83496 ',' If there is a better site , someone needs to tell me. ','?'
'id: 83500 ',' Gives so many ideas needs a warning, "Don  t read near husband, will create Honey Do list overload and husband will explode." ','?'

'id: 83617 ',' Im a pinterest addict just like everyone else! ','?'
'id: 83617 ',' A few features I  d love to see added though would be a key word search amongst your pins, I have a lot of pins and searching through them all can take a while. ','?'
'id: 83640 ',' I love this app, it has its moments, like suddenly force closing after leaving it idle for a while or not having the option to edit your pins amd move them like you can do from a PC but I am sure those will be fixed in the long run with the updates, otherwise great app : D , ','?'
'id: 83654 ',' The idea of making some boards private is also useful for planning events. ','?'

'id: 83858 ',' It is like you can create a personal magazine. ','?'
'id: 83858 ',' \\nI love it and have used the ideas and the "How to do", would be lost without this sight. ','?'
'id: 83860 ',' Both need the ability to resize the pinned photos  on the phone app, it  d be nice if I could zoom in so only one shows at a time. ','?'
'id: 83871 ',' The new "load more like this" thing that shows up is a good idea, but then I can  t see the pin and have to move the picture around to read the whole thing , ','?'
'id: 83874 ',' The idea of Pinterest is quite perfect! ','?'
'id: 83874 ',' One thing about this app\\nI wish developers  d do is to have   Source/URL   space available, just like the full website, in addition to   Photo Description   and   Choose Folder  . ','?'
'id: 83882 ',' It works great, but requires the full website to change some settings, I love it!!!! ','?'

'id: 84069 ',' There are so many wonderful ideas and tasty recipes. ','?'
'id: 84095 ',' The app is easy and the ideas are endless!! ','?'
'id: 84106 ',' What a gift not to have to remember where I saw a recipe or lamp or gift idea....could go on and on. ','?'
'id: 84108 ',' The only reason it gets 4 stars is that about 1 in 15 times when I  m on it the app randomly crashes. ','?'
'id: 84115 ',' Yes, it  s a mental problem. ','?'
'id: 84121 ',' I recommend this to everybody!!! ','?'

'id: 84146 ',' The best downloading decision I ever made!!! ','?'

'id: 84149 ',' This alternate universe just has lots of inspiration for so many things. ','?'
'id: 84154 ',' Awesome but is a little glitchy and will crash at times , ','?'
'id: 84156 ',' For example a recipe board:  a dessert board   well you pin a whole bunch of desserts within the board and then you should of divided the category into chocolate desserts, cakes, cookies, pies etc and to go back to do that you have to go in and do one by one and pin on a new board. ','?'
'id: 84156 ',' Also it would be nice to have some tags on the boards for recipes that worked or didn  t work do it is easier to find when u search for that one recipe. ','?'
'id: 84170 ',' So many ideas so little time..love Pinterest especially since I am a visual person ...just be careful, you can spend hours pinning  and not even realize. ','?'
'id: 84199 ',' They have since been fixed and the bugs are rare. ','?'
'id: 84200 ',' Why does it fluctuate how much memory it takes up on my iPhone? ','?'
'id: 84208 ',' it crashes sometimes but besides that I love it. ','?'
'id: 84220 ',' Only problem is it crashes every once in a while but eh. ','?'
'id: 84226 ',' Alias1990 ,  Why does a blip pop up when you click on an item saying "scroll down for more pins on this item"?? ','?'
'id: 84254 ',' I love Pinterest, but my app crashes quite a bit. ','?'
'id: 84268 ',' My only real issue is that the app still crashes from time to time (which is particularly frustrating when I have my eye on a pin I want to check out, but can never find it again). ','?'
'id: 84275 ',' The only thing is instead of pinning, I need to try the things I  ve pinned. ','?'
'id: 84289 ',' Just download it. ','?'
'id: 84298 ',' enjoy looking at what people post and follow your friends , ','?'
'id: 84306 ',' Every update that they did seemed to be a good choice and added value to their site. ','?'

'id: 84338 ',' The only problem is that I  m totally addicted to this site , ','?'
'id: 84344 ',' There are so many interesting ideas and tips. ','?'
'id: 84347 ',' Don  t create an account, if you  re not willing to become addicted to something. ','?'
'id: 84356 ',' You could tell a story just by the arrangement and visual flow pf your pins; you could make a list, just by being able to re order the pictures on a board. ','?'
'id: 84361 ',' \\nIt needs a search within the boards on individual profiles. ','?'
'id: 84363 ',' Please remove the scroll arrow!!!! ','?'
'id: 84384 ',' Please take away the EXTREMELY ANNOYING "click here for related posts" arrow!!! ','?'
'id: 84385 ',' All I want to do is pin pin pin no matter what what what : D If you don  t have this yet you need to sign up! ','?'
'id: 84387 ',' I am unable to log in on my phone. ','?'
'id: 84393 ',' All the glitches from previous updates have been fixed! ','?'
'id: 84407 ',' Pretty old so I  m sure that  s why it crashes so much. ','?'
'id: 84419 ',' Please take away the arrow. ','?'
'id: 84425 ',' Other wise I just need to limit myself or a whole day can be used up on scrolling through all the sweet pins on Pinterest:) , ','?'

'id: 86974 ',' Just need the time to try it all!! ','?'

'id: 86982 ',' Please remove it! ','?'
'id: 86982 ',' I keep checking in hopes they update and remove it. ','?'
'id: 86989 ',' Only thing is I can  t figure out how to change the caption when I repin an item. ','?'
'id: 87013 ',' It seems like many previous bugs have been fixed. ','?'
'id: 87024 ',' Almost never crashes. ','?'
'id: 87031 ',' Just like the computer website. ','?'
'id: 87035 ',' Ever since I updated my app it shuts down every time I select a pin to check out the website. ','?'
'id: 87047 ',' There are so many great ideas out there and this app makes sharing them and saving them for later so easy. ','?'

'id: 87144 ',' I wish there were a way to rate ideas I  ve tried from Pinterest   some turn out great but others not. ','?'
'id: 87146 ',' I recommend it to everyone! ','?'
'id: 87157 ',' Rather than searching all over the internet, I know I will pretty much always find ideas that will work for me on pinterest. ','?'
'id: 87162 ',' Only problem is that it can be slow at loading. ','?'
'id: 87165 ',' It used to crash on me all the time, but seems they worked the bugs out. ','?'

'id: 87210 ',' The entire idea behind Pintrest is a brilliant one and the app works beautifully. ','?'
'id: 87212 ',' But ever since I updated it there is the annoying black box that pops up recommending more pins like it with the big arrow in the middle of the pins. ','?'
'id: 87218 ',' I have only had one problem with the app. ','?'
'id: 87231 ',' Anything you  d ever need is all in this one app!! ','?'
'id: 87242 ',' s ,  Not sure how to answer the question above. ','?'
'id: 87243 ',' Never had any issues with the app. ','?'
'id: 87249 ',' I love redoing my clothes and furniture so this app is the perfect way to find new ideas that are with me when I  m doing the project! ','?'
'id: 87261 ',' And that you can create a new board while you are pinning something. ','?'
'id: 87272 ',' It is helping me to plan my outfits &amp; enjoy shopping again. ','?'
'id: 87272 ',' I just love it!! ','?'
'id: 87285 ',' Is there a rehab for pinterest addiction? ','?'
'id: 87313 ',' I love pinterest, but it crashes on me every couple of minutes, very frustrating. ','?'
'id: 87313 ',' I can use it on my desktop with no problem, so must be in the app itself. ','?'
'id: 87313 ',' I have the original iPad, so maybe that is the problem? ','?'
'id: 87317 ',' App crashes sometimes and I get many "oops something went wrong on our side" messages. ','?'
'id: 87317 ',' \\n\\nOther than that, it  s Pinterest and it does what you  d expect. ','?'
'id: 87320 ',' So I click the photo to learn how to make them and the redirect says I need to click the photo to go to the Pinterest site so I click and the app pops up a box and says you can  t goto the Pinterest site from this app. ','?'
'id: 87323 ',' The app version for iPhones is great, but it  s upsetting when it crashes &amp; freezes so much. ','?'
'id: 87323 ',' Also, it would be nice to edit a pin after pinning it. ','?'
'id: 87325 ',' Now I don  t have to wait until I get home to look through new pins. ','?'
'id: 87328 ',' This app is all I need. ','?'
'id: 87340 ',' If you don   find your niche just do a search. ','?'
'id: 87343 ',' I can  t think of anything you could do to improve the Pinterest app. ','?'
'id: 87354 ',' But I don  t get why sometimes someone showed a great idea but when you go to it they don  t show how to do it. ','?'
'id: 87364 ',' Why is this app fraught with errors and bugs?? ','?'
'id: 87377 ',' Everything you could ever want to do, recipes you want to try, craft you want to make etc. you can find links and inspirations door from this one app , ','?'
'id: 87382 ',' Only thing I wish about app is that I have so many pins on boards now that I can  t scroll through them all. ','?'
'id: 87383 ',' Yes, it is very addictive, but being addicted to inspiration is a good thing. ','?'
'id: 87384 ',' I love all the new categories and haven  t had any issues! ','?'
'id: 87387 ',' Never have any problems and cam always find things I need. ','?'
'id: 87403 ',' Pinterest is a certified addiction and this app just catapults it . ','?'
'id: 87408 ',' The only glitch I  ve come across almost every time is that it crashes several times during use. ','?'
'id: 87432 ',' There are so many ideas for everything you can imagine. ','?'
'id: 87437 ',' You need to have a way to add pins with an add pin button the way you have on the web based version. ','?'
'id: 87461 ',' I just love Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 87463 ',' The best when you need ideas and inspiration. ','?'
'id: 87463 ',' Also the best when you need to kill time. ','?'
'id: 87531 ',' The only thing I would say would be useful to change is to make it so not so many of the same things pop up ha! ','?'
'id: 87539 ',' Pinterest has such great ideas on how to decorate and most ideas are cheap. ','?'
'id: 87544 ',' It has some bugs for the phone app still but that won  t stop me from using it. ','?'
'id: 87577 ',' Definitely recommend it to everyone. ','?'
'id: 87578 ',' Just like the website. ','?'
'id: 87578 ',' Never crashes!! ','?'
'id: 87589 ',' Love having this app so everything is right here , ','?'
'id: 87608 ',' Definitely recommend the App to anyone! ','?'
'id: 87662 ',' Love this app...can  t get enough!!! ','?'
'id: 87692 ',' It crashes occasionally but overall a great app , ','?'
'id: 87706 ',' I wish it would tell you that you already pinned something and that you could separate out multiple pins at once. ','?'
'id: 87708 ',' Love this app, is exactly what I need and love the updates as well! ','?'
'id: 87733 ',' Please change this! ','?'
'id: 87740 ',' This app made my Pinterest addiction even worse. ','?'
'id: 87745 ',' Kicks me off every 3 min when it updates that category, then takes me back to the main menu, please make an update for the iPod touch 4th gen. , ','?'
'id: 87813 ',' I love this app for it  s purpose, but it tends to crash when i open a larger image or pin. ','?'
'id: 87821 ',' My only issue is that if I use it for an extended period, the images don  t always load, so I  ll be scrolling through a seemingly endless reel of grey boxes with text underneath. ','?'
'id: 87831 ',' Pinterest gives me so many good ideas about style and DIY projects, ideas for all they styles I love and how to go about doing them! ','?'
'id: 87836 ',' It can  t sway my opinion of the actual site, though. ','?'
'id: 87837 ',' I really don  t like the related pins arrow that pops up when you open a pin, it blocks what you were trying to look at in the first place! ','?'
'id: 87842 ',' The iPad version should have like and repin buttons on the main screen. ','?'
'id: 87855 ',' The updates have made this my favorite app!!! ','?'
'id: 87875 ',' Perfect when I just need to pass the time. ','?'
'id: 87896 ',' Every two minutes the app crashes or kicks me out. ','?'
'id: 87897 ',' Everyone should have a Pinterest account! ','?'
'id: 87898 ',' Doesn  t crash as much as the older versions. ','?'
'id: 87905 ',' That  s insane even if its storing user data the app shouldn  t be allowed to keep going and should have a cap. ','?'
'id: 87906 ',' Whitney Downum ,  Can  t complian! ','?'
'id: 87907 ',' This app is great but for the fact that you can  t create new pins! ','?'
'id: 87924 ',' I love the Pinterest app, also it randomly crashed and freezes. ','?'
'id: 87931 ',' I sorta stumbled on this on my own because people in my group of friends don  t know how to make recommendations. ','?'
'id: 87935 ',' Sometimes I just can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 87936 ',' If you feel the arrow needs to be there, please have an option to move it or disable it. ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' \\nThe problem is that I  ve tried to get clarification, but I don  t know if I  ve contacted the right source. ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' Pinterest can  t possibly deny it knows that, and id like to know how you validate the content or the quality with a straight face. ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' But I  don  t intend to cast my pearls before swine nor be held responsible for someone else  s behavior. ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' \\nIn addition, I  m currently staying away   for now, for the most part   because I can  t deal with the frustration of the temperamental nature of the board  s function. ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' \\nI don  t understand explanations that pop up saying " you have no pins available" (?) ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' I read about   secret boards   for hours, understanding how to make them, but not why I would want one. ','?'
'id: 87943 ',' Why learn it when it maybe it  s time to leave for elusive reasons? ','?'
'id: 87951 ',' I notice a few other pincers have the same problem so I  m sure the problem is being addressed. ','?'
'id: 87960 ',' Please make it easier!! ','?'
'id: 88000 ',' Great app, I just miss the like button since the update! ','?'
'id: 88010 ',' Once you start, you can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 88016 ',' Everyone should have this app , ','?'
'id: 88024 ',' I wish that you could set your profile to private so only the people you follow &amp; ur followers could see it. ','?'
'id: 88025 ',' I luv Pinterest its the most used app on my iPod so get it bc you  ll lUv it like me , ','?'
'id: 88035 ',' \\n\\nIf you haven  t joined the thousands or millions of people just like me, my only advice is to set aside a good chunk of time that you can devote to it. ','?'
'id: 88044 ',' The only thing I have issue with is that new black box thing that sits in the middle of the pic... Get rid of it!! ','?'
'id: 88048 ',' Pinterest has become my"go to" spot when I need to know how to do something or looking for new recipes or for inspiration for a new project. ','?'
'id: 88051 ',' I don  t know what they did on the last update that they think they needed to have a big arrow in the middle of the screen that says scroll down to see related pins and it won  t go away! ','?'
'id: 88058 ',' You need to invent a faster way to repin stuff. ','?'
'id: 88073 ',' App Crashes all the time for no apparent reason. ','?'
'id: 88075 ',' I wish the mobile app wouldn  t shut down randomly and that the boards could be alphabetized on the computer. ','?'
'id: 88086 ',' I "like" more posts than I pin because the pick a board page is so slow loading and sometimes loses the post I intended to pin. ','?'
'id: 88095 ',' The only reason I gave it three stars is because the app constantly crashes and it keeps bugging me to review it. ','?'
'id: 88099 ',' It  s a hassle to Unfollow, and just because I liked one pin, I always see them for then on on my home page. ','?'
'id: 88110 ',' Just pay your money and download this app! ','?'
'id: 88127 ',' I could spend hours just browsing pins! ','?'
'id: 88130 ',' Love Pinterest could use some more bug fixes though =) , ','?'
'id: 88140 ',' Rarely ever have problems. ','?'
'id: 88150 ',' I love this app there are so many interesting, new, and creatively fun ideas that I could never have imagined!! ','?'
'id: 88151 ',' The app still has a few small kinks that need to be worked out, but they  re improving everyday. ','?'
'id: 88153 ',' My only problem with the app is that I can  t add new pins and that  s very frustrating! ','?'
'id: 88155 ',' Problem it crashes a lot and takes up way, way to much space on my phone. ','?'
'id: 88161 ',' It  s a wonderful way to get my mind off of things:) but one problem is sometimes when I try to unlike things the app just shuts down and I have to reopen it. ','?'
'id: 88164 ',' I don  t like the functionality and it crashes on me sometimes. ','?'
'id: 88164 ',' The app could also use some speed enhancements. ','?'
'id: 88164 ',' So far not too bad but I still can  t help feeling that it  s still missing something , ','?'
'id: 88171 ',' Annoyed Buckeye ,  Seriously, I have removed and reinstalled this app at least a dozen times and I still can  t log in with my Facebook account. ','?'
'id: 88173 ',' This is a 4+ app, but it occasionally will close out on me, so just a tiny bit short of a 5* app. ','?'
'id: 88173 ',' Love Pinterest and I  ve made quite a few pins successfully! ','?'
'id: 88178 ',' I thought Pinterest wa just for stayathomemoms&amp;all about crafts, but actually there  s so much more to Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 88185 ',' Two stars until that   update   is removed or updated to allow an opt out! ','?'
'id: 88200 ',' I really like using the app, but it seriously crashes very 15 minutes. ','?'
'id: 88200 ',' It  s ridiculous and this should be fixed , ','?'
'id: 88209 ',' I do have some issues with crashing sometimes and I wish you could zoom in on images without actually opening them. ','?'
'id: 88216 ',' Has provided some amazing ideas, tips, solutions, motivation and delicious recipes. ','?'
'id: 88217 ',' I don  t understand why it needs the storage since its all over the Internet. ','?'
'id: 88218 ',' I would have liked to have a messaging option and more private boards option. ','?'
'id: 88220 ',' I don  t know how people planned their wedding before Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 88247 ',' Gives me so many great ideas for everything from how to dress to what to cook. ','?'
'id: 88247 ',' What in the world did I do without it? ','?'
'id: 88255 ',' But if you just scroll down the first time it doesn  t happen again! ','?'
'id: 88261 ',' my only complaint is that you can  t swipe from image to image, instead you have to hit back. ','?'
'id: 88263 ',' Just get it. ','?'
'id: 88282 ',' I recommend it to everyone! ','?'
'id: 88289 ',' I can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 88292 ',' I LOVE this app but it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 88293 ',' New update crashes less. ','?'
'id: 88295 ',' Only "complaint" is I wish you could unpin things. ','?'

'id: 88331 ',' I don  t have a problem with the upgrade. ','?'
'id: 88332 ',' I recommend this site for creative people! ','?'
'id: 88337 ',' Just discovered Pinterest and I can  t stop using it! ','?'
'id: 88341 ',' I haven  t had any problems with the iPad app. ','?'
'id: 88345 ',' I have absolutely no problems with this app! ','?'
'id: 88353 ',' There are issues with it, but I still love it , ','?'
'id: 88368 ',' Can you please remove the scroll down thingy!?! ','?'
'id: 88368 ',' I can  t use this app on my phone, cause I can  t see anything!!! ','?'
'id: 88373 ',' Please takeaway the arrow in the middle of the photos. ','?'
'id: 88374 ',' I  m on it everyday and I can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 88375 ',' Please remove the scroll down box. ','?'
'id: 88375 ',' I hope it gets removed soon. ','?'
'id: 88376 ',' I LOVE Pinterest BUT this app is having problems, problems, problems. ','?'
'id: 88376 ',' I can  t log in right now, and before that it would randomly stop working and/or shut down various times. ','?'
'id: 88384 ',' The scroll down to see other pins box needs to go. ','?'
'id: 88386 ',' You can  t even see what it is that you clicked on to see! ','?'
'id: 88389 ',' I just downloaded the app for the first time and I also hate the arrow. ','?'
'id: 88390 ',' Please remove it right away so this app is fun to use again! ','?'
'id: 88391 ',' You wonder how did I get here and can I ever find my way back? ','?'
'id: 88393 ',' Please fix this and fast. ','?'
'id: 88394 ',' IT IS SO ANNOYING since you can  t fully see the images the way you would like because this watermark stamped in the middle and never leaves. ','?'
'id: 88397 ',' I  ll miss it, but I like having my Ipad back! ','?'
'id: 88398 ',' Nikkij20 ,  love this app but like everyone is saying there is some stuff that needs to be fixed so please fix. ','?'
'id: 88399 ',' What happened? ','?'
'id: 88400 ',' Love the ap but they have added this "scroll down" pop up that is very annoying and in the way of the pin. ','?'
'id: 88403 ',' If you have the app you know you can scroll down!! ','?'
'id: 88404 ',' You can  t view anything because of the scroll arrow. ','?'
'id: 88407 ',' I want to know who thought putting that DIRECTLY over the pin picture was a good idea? ','?'
'id: 88407 ',' Please change it. ','?'
'id: 88409 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 88411 ',' I do personally think the scroll is a great idea that needs more fine tuning, but dang you people are hostile reviewers ! ','?'
'id: 88416 ',' Only way to delete it all quickly was to delete the whole app and reinstall and re sign in. ','?'
'id: 88416 ',' I don  t pay attention to my much larger iPad as I don  t need to worry about space. ','?'
'id: 88417 ',' What dumb, ignorant, ridiculous force in this world would make you create that stupid arrow! ','?'
'id: 88419 ',' The only complaint I have with it is its random crashes. ','?'
'id: 88419 ',' Something that you all SERIOUSLY need to add to the app is the ability to search within what you  ve already pinned. ','?'
'id: 88419 ',' I have literally THOUSANDS of pins now, and unfortunately create duplicate pins because I want something to be close to the top of my board for easier access when I need it. ','?'
'id: 88419 ',' Please fix this and the lame buggy crashes, and I  ll be completely and utterly satisfied!! ','?'
'id: 88424 ',' Please fix this problem!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 88426 ',' Please remove!!!! ','?'
'id: 88427 ',' Please fix this!!!!! ','?'
'id: 88429 ',' I cannot look at the pin I intend to look at because this huge "scroll down" message is right in the middle of the screen. ','?'
'id: 88430 ',' I  ve just closed out multiple times this week because the scroll thing is in the way!!! ','?'
'id: 88433 ',' If only I were smart enough to figure out how to get back to the previous version. ','?'
'id: 88440 ',' Its reallu good, but lately it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 88440 ',' Why is marking number of pins and number of likes the same? ','?'
'id: 88444 ',' It takes a very long time when I need to log in or when I first open the app, and it crashes frequently if I press too many pictures without pausing in between. ','?'
'id: 88445 ',' What do I do on my work breaks? ','?'
'id: 88446 ',' I need to do a massive clean up and would hate to re pin everything! ','?'
'id: 88448 ',' I never had a problem before , ','?'
'id: 88455 ',' What is the point? ','?'
'id: 88457 ',' Since I updated, I can  t access anything. ','?'
'id: 88458 ',' This was my favorite app ever since the update it crashes and it doesn  t allow me to log in. ','?'
'id: 88460 ',' Please remove this obstructive image!! ','?'
'id: 88461 ',' I thought it was only temporary so I got completely out of the app for a whole day. ','?'
'id: 88464 ',' Fix it, please. ','?'
'id: 88465 ',' Who thought a scroll down button on top of a pin was a good idea? ','?'
'id: 88466 ',' Please please hurry up and fix the bugs! ','?'
'id: 88467 ',' Please remove this feature. ','?'
'id: 88467 ',' I am unable to see anything. ','?'
'id: 88471 ',' Please remove it! ','?'
'id: 88475 ',' Every time I unlike something the App crashes. ','?'
'id: 88477 ',' Who  s idea was that :  ((( that one made me really happy I say bring it bad and you can have you five stars , ','?'
'id: 88478 ',' Why can  t you just leave a good thing alone. ','?'
'id: 88479 ',' It needs something to cover up the pictures." ','?'
'id: 88481 ',' Why do we have the new square with the arrow that tells us to scroll down to see like posts? ','?'
'id: 88481 ',' I know how to use the search feature, don  t need the arrow!! ','?'
'id: 88484 ',' Why can  t Pinterest be like Facebook and store the usage on the website instead of your iPod or iPhone because I have almost no space on my iPod can you please do this, but I do really like Pinterest that is where I spend all of my time on my iPod. ','?'
'id: 88485 ',' \\nThere are still issues with the app randomly closing, especially when opening a browser within the build. ','?'
'id: 88489 ',' Please remove the arrow, it  s obnoxious. ','?'
'id: 88494 ',' I can pull it Pinterest up on my laptop and its fine but on my phone pics won  t load it  s just blank or black or some strange color please fix it the update messed it up!! ','?'
'id: 88497 ',' It would be nice if there was an easier way to reorganize pins in my board. ','?'
'id: 88497 ',' for example I originally just had a board for food now I wish that I could split it into meals an desserts but it takes FOREVER to do it. ','?'
'id: 88498 ',' Pinterest is nothing BUT scrolling down, we don  t need a reminder that blocks the current pin we are trying to view. ','?'
'id: 88499 ',' Please remove the arrow reminding me to scroll down for related pins. ','?'
'id: 88500 ',' Why would Pinterest choose to then put a giant scroll down arrow right on top of the image? ','?'
'id: 88500 ',' Please remove that arrow. ','?'
'id: 88502 ',' Juanita248 ,  Telling me once that there are relatable pins is all the info I need. ','?'
'id: 88507 ',' Now every time I try and save a picture it won  t show up in my album on my phone (everywhere else it works fine) or the app stays loading, freezes then crashes. ','?'
'id: 88507 ',' Why fix something if it wasn  t broken? ','?'
'id: 88508 ',' Love Pinterest, but the app needs some work. ','?'
'id: 88508 ',' So then you end up never finding the pin you needed for your project. ','?'
'id: 88511 ',' Since I am unable to view pins normally, I click on them to open a new screen. ','?'
'id: 88513 ',' Please get rid of the stupid arrow I can  t even look at the picture! ','?'
'id: 88519 ',' The app is great otherwise, I just hate this new aggravating addition. ','?'
'id: 88520 ',' Please take that big ugly box away. ','?'
'id: 88522 ',' Take it away, please. ','?'
'id: 88532 ',' Do not like the obnoxious arrow, please get rid of it!! ','?'
'id: 88532 ',' Love everything else, just dump the arrow. ','?'
'id: 88533 ',' Please remove this is making me want to stop using the app. ','?'
'id: 88536 ',' Why did you have to mess it up with that annoying arrow in the middle of the screen? ','?'
'id: 88536 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 88538 ',' Loose the recently added Scroll Down Arrow. ','?'
'id: 88539 ',' Please fix it ASAP! ','?'
'id: 88545 ',' The "scroll down to see more pins" box is the dumbest idea in the world, you can  t see and/ or read whatever it is because of the dumb black box in the way!!! ','?'
'id: 88552 ',' It is perfect for anything you could want! ','?'
'id: 88553 ',' I love the app I have made so many creations , ','?'
'id: 88556 ',' Only thing I can see that it  s missing is that you don  t know if someone commented on a post or replied to a comment. ','?'
'id: 88557 ',' It needs to go away . ','?'

'id: 88604 ',' Please take it off!!!!! ','?'
'id: 88605 ',' When you go to a source from a pin it crashes on my iPad ALL THE TIME. ','?'

'id: 88646 ',' Literally, gave my self 10 minutes to pin some pics to a certain board, and between the app crashing, not scrolling down all the way unless to refresh and them scroll alllllll the way down first, and still having your pins "liked" even though you had "unliked" them pretty much made me quit using Pinterest.

'id: 88654 ',' Annab15hdb ,  I updated the app and the scroll down to see related whatevers thin is always in the way of what u r trying to see and it won  t go away!!! ','?'
'id: 88658 ',' It  d be even more awesome though if we could have folders in our boards so we can find our pins easier. ','?'
'id: 88658 ',' For example on my recipes board we could have folders with breakfast, dessert, supper, etc. instead of having to search out pins forever or creating too many boards , ','?'
'id: 88659 ',' It constantly crashes, the scroll down to see similar pins reminder won  t go away, the app locks up when trying to save images to your phone and when it doesn  t, the image doesn  t even save. ','?'
'id: 88662 ',' Please make this go away! ','?'
'id: 88665 ',' Current version gives a grey icon showing to scroll down and you can  t look at the item without opening it completely! ','?'
'id: 88670 ',' Please remove the scroll down to view related posts. ','?'
'id: 88675 ',' But why oh why did you out that semi transparent scroll down bar over every pin? ','?'
'id: 88676 ',' And to those of you giving this app a bad review, it could be your phone because ive had no problems with the updates. ','?'
'id: 88679 ',' App needs to be quicker with less crashing. ','?'
'id: 88681 ',' It crashes so much more then it used to. ','?'
'id: 88681 ',' whenever I try to pin something on to certain boards it crashes and I lose the pin! ','?'
'id: 88685 ',' EFCfan10 ,  The app is awful, it never works right and freezes constantly ! ','?'
'id: 88686 ',' If I weren  t for the fact that it crashes on a regular basis, this would be a perfect app. ','?'
'id: 88689 ',' Why would they do that?? ','?'
'id: 88691 ',' Please take it away! ','?'
'id: 88697 ',' Please add this feature!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 88708 ',' Please add a search feature so we can search for something within our personal boards and pins. ','?'

'id: 88714 ',' I too have not been able to log in with the last couple updates. ','?'
'id: 88718 ',' There are a few pins I  d like to make from outside sites, but I can  t. Still like the app   there is a lot to look at, but it  s frustrating that it crashes so frequently. ','?'
'id: 88721 ',' The one thing I do no like is that it crashed pretty frequently and closes the app. ','?'
'id: 88722 ',' Would give five stars if there were an easy way to upload my iPhone photos to my boards. ','?'
'id: 88726 ',' Which is why I  m so ANGRY that I can  t load pictures without the app crashing. ','?'
'id: 88729 ',' I use Pinterest everyday and I am thankful that you have created an app for people to use on their phones. ','?'
'id: 88729 ',' But the app always kicks me off, repins things twice, freezes, or is unable to log me in because of "error: there is a problem on our end". ','?'
'id: 88732 ',' Please remove the scroll down to see similar pins feature. ','?'
'id: 88733 ',' I can log in fine on the website so I  m not sure what the problem is. ','?'

'id: 88764 ',' ;) I don  t like how it crashes though :( , ','?'
'id: 88767 ',' It  s almost an addiction for me, but you just did an update and now an arrow pops up and tells me to scroll down for similar pins. ','?'
'id: 88768 ',' please get rid of it!!! ','?'
'id: 88769 ',' I just wish there was a way to drag a pin from one board to another without re pinning it to the new board and deleting it from the old. ','?'
'id: 88771 ',' I think there should be an option to organize what you have liked under a category ...such as beauty/food/DIY  because when you go to look for something In particular it takes forever to find because you liked so many things . ','?'
'id: 88771 ',' I  m new to this so if there is a way than forgive me...maybe I need to make a secret board? ','?'
'id: 88773 ',' Tempted to delete the app now because of this epic fail. ','?'
'id: 88776 ',' I don  t know what they did when they updated this app but the scroll down for similar posts on every pin is obnoxious. ','?'
'id: 88782 ',' Please remove this! ','?'
'id: 88786 ',' Everyone should have this. ','?'
'id: 88789 ',' The only improvement I can suggest is a way to search your own pins. ','?'

'id: 88808 ',' I would rate it but can  t login even after updating and restarting, PINTEREST how hard is it to get it right? ','?'
'id: 88810 ',' Can you try to fix this bug. ','?'
'id: 88819 ',' I recommend it to everyone! ','?'

'id: 89000 ',' Sometimes the app crashes, usually trying to show me a big pin. ','?'
'id: 89002 ',' The only issue I have is that it keeps closing the app when I open a link to see the original page. ','?'

'id: 92628 ',' Kdog324 ,  I need Pintrest rehab. ','?'
'id: 92647 ',' I do wish you would tell us when we already pinned something so we don  t have doubles of things. ','?'
'id: 92655 ',' The only complaint is that if you post something on one board you cannot move it to another without repinning. ','?'
'id: 92655 ',' I wish that you could move things around within your boards. ','?'
'id: 92657 ',' This was a great idea by whoever started it. ','?'
'id: 92660 ',' Before the latest update it wouldn  t save any pictures now after I updated it, it freezes every time I save. ','?'

'id: 92813 ',' Luv how some pins lead you to actual sites that you can purchase from!!! ','?'
'id: 92848 ',' I am very slow to accepting new technology and after I just had my last baby, I find that I am constantly entertaining myself with Pinterest during feedings. ','?'
'id: 92851 ',' Sometimes it freaks out and says no pins available but you actually do. ','?'
'id: 92860 ',' There are soooooo many good ideas and diys. ','?'
'id: 92867 ',' And I HATE that you  re choosing for me who I  m really following. ','?'
'id: 92868 ',' I highly recommend it if you haven  t checked it out. ','?'
'id: 92880 ',' There is no end to the boards you can create or the ideas you can pin to them. ','?'
'id: 92884 ',' I try to pin them, which seems okay, but when I "unlike them" my app crashes. ','?'
'id: 92912 ',' Over all I just love the idea of being able to gather and collecting pics of interests and not having it take up physical room. ','?'
'id: 92963 ',' On my iPhone 5 it will either open and just load forever on the Pinterest page or it will fail to log in. ','?'
'id: 92976 ',' Amazing app I can spend all day on it but I agree with some people it needs more categories and for me that is the one missing star. ','?'
'id: 92993 ',' Pinterest is an addiction and the app just helps it! ','?'
'id: 93008 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 93009 ',' Everything you  ve ever wanted to learn how to do is right here. ','?'
'id: 93018 ',' The newest version of the app has problems. ','?'
'id: 93018 ',' When I go to resin something, often the repinning box either doesn  t show up at all or shows up but moves so far down on the screen that you can  t get to your boards. ','?'
'id: 93025 ',' I can find anything I am looking for? ','?'
'id: 93026 ',' Great app but still has some bugs to be worked out. ','?'
'id: 93047 ',' I love this app great ideas for dinner makes meal planning so much easier so many ideas that could be shared across people,fantastic idea! ','?'
'id: 93051 ',' It has crashed quite a lot, &amp; it bugs me that if I go through a Pinterest wormhole &amp; start clicking on things, when I try to go back and keep scrolling through my list, it will send me to the top. ','?'
'id: 93054 ',' I need Pinterest rehab. ','?'
'id: 93057 ',' There is nothing I would change about it expect it needs a couple bug fixes but other than that, I LOVE it!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 93070 ',' You tend to have to scroll far or wait a month to find something new , ','?'
'id: 93075 ',' It would be nice if the spot of the page I was just on would still be there after I navigate back from looking at a pin. ','?'
'id: 93091 ',' I love to waste time browsing silly, animal pictures, looking at the latest fashions, guilting myself into working out and how to accomplish it when I get around to it. ','?'
'id: 93091 ',' There is no other way to scout out good meals that I  ve enjoyed more than Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 93093 ',' Sometimes when I unlike pins, the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 93101 ',' I really like having the Pinterest app but since I did the last update I hate that I have to scroll all the way back to the top and can  t just tap the Pinterest label like I used to. ','?'
'id: 93122 ',' It is random when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 93124 ',' But one problem I  ve been noticing lately since I last updated is that on very long pins, it doesn  t show the box that you choose what board you want to pin it to. ','?'
'id: 93127 ',' While I love the Idea of this app,it crashes ALL the time. ','?'
'id: 93127 ',' It would be nice if this could be fixed, =) , ','?'
'id: 93147 ',' Best site around no need to go to several different sites they are all here and have great knowledge. ','?'

'id: 93275 ',' I absolutely love Pinterest and the app is very easy to use but I have been having problems with the app crashing on me on a regular basis. ','?'
'id: 93277 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 93282 ',' I really like this app, but it crashes a lot, and can be quite laggy. ','?'
'id: 93287 ',' The one flaw this app has is that it will occasionally fail to load, but exiting out and back in is an easy fix to an occasional problem. ','?'
'id: 93306 ',' Once I figured out how to navigate the site I loved it! ','?'
'id: 93310 ',' Effective is the big word here. ','?'
'id: 93320 ',' I highly recommend the DIY section. ','?'
'id: 93320 ',' There are so many great ideas! ','?'
'id: 93324 ',' Great ideas that are easy to share and fun. ','?'
'id: 93337 ',' I have also had problems when pinning images that are long. ','?'
'id: 93339 ',' However with the most recent update you Have to manually scroll to the top of the page. ','?'
'id: 93350 ',' I haven  t really had any problems with it so I am gonna give  5 stars! ','?'
'id: 93351 ',' It fails about 30% of the time. ','?'
'id: 93360 ',' Love it everyone should have this!! ','?'
'id: 93374 ',' I  ve got my wedding planned already...and I  m not even engaged. ','?'
'id: 93375 ',' Things that make you want to say, "why haven  t I thought of that?" ','?'
'id: 93380 ',' I just love this site , ','?'
'id: 93382 ',' Now I will say it loads slowly sometimes and will crash very rarely (PLEASE fix that someone!!!!) ','?'
'id: 93391 ',' I would like to see a way to search in your own pins...to find a recipe, craft, idea, etc quicker! ','?'
'id: 93413 ',' I sometimes accidentally post the same thing twice and I  d like to delete duplicate posts. ','?'
'id: 93430 ',' And the app just fuels my addiction! ','?'
'id: 93433 ',' But the app crashes sometimes and the pics are tiny on the phone (it  s a phone, what can you do.) ','?'
'id: 93435 ',' The app is much more responsive and doesn  t crash. ','?'
'id: 93439 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 93444 ',' Can  t stay of it!! ','?'
'id: 93449 ',' Still needs work, all the pictures wont download, crashes frequently, but love my Pinterest still! ','?'
'id: 93454 ',' only downside is that it crashes and doesn  t always show me all my likes. ','?'
'id: 93456 ',' Has made many improvements but still crashes sometimes. ','?'
'id: 93459 ',' The ideas are endless and oh so useful! ','?'
'id: 93464 ',' Has never crashed. ','?'
'id: 93485 ',' The only thing that would make it better if there was some way it could tell you had already pinned something. ','?'
'id: 93487 ',' Everything you need to know and more! ','?'
'id: 93494 ',' I couldn  t live without my pinterest :) but it always crashes on me :( , ','?'
'id: 93500 ',' I have one gripe though...why does this application need to use so much space? ','?'
'id: 93500 ',' Can we add a "Clear cache" button? ','?'
'id: 93518 ',' Ive made many recipes and done severall projects ive pinned. ','?'
'id: 93522 ',' I just don  t like how my feed almost seems like it repeats itself. ','?'
'id: 93526 ',' Love it, I  ve found so many great recipes and hair how to  s love love love , ','?'
'id: 93537 ',' I can  t stop and wont stop!!! ','?'
'id: 93539 ',' But you must get Pinterest, it will change your life! ','?'
'id: 93555 ',' I love this app, but after the last update, there is no longer a way to return to the top of the feed without scrolling through everything again. ','?'
'id: 93558 ',' I just wish there was a more direct way to get the pin button for safari pins. ','?'
'id: 93562 ',' I  d honestly recommend it to anyone. ','?'
'id: 93571 ',' I  ve found soooo many things that I can use everyday. ','?'
'id: 93579 ',' I give the app a 4.5/5 even though I technically can  t do that on iTunes. ','?'
'id: 93594 ',' I wish that you could convert a public viewing board to a secret board as opposed to creating a secret board from scratch. ','?'
'id: 93602 ',' Are you guys going to let us create board collections for example: "kid party ideas", "kid toys", and "kid fashion" boards can all be collected under the header "kids". ','?'
'id: 93614 ',' Very hard to look at the pics without the white border like on a photo   everything just blurs, the suggested pins are too random and not linked to the topic and ruins the fun of discovery...and still haven  t found one I like anyway, I don  t want to open things up to like or share, and I  d like the X back where it was (I don  t share anyway because I have to post it on my FB timeline instead of the timeline of the person I want to share it with anyway). ','?'
'id: 93614 ',' What did these updates achieve? ','?'
'id: 93614 ',' I wish I knew how to restore the old app. ','?'
'id: 93622 ',' And I hate how on the new update I can  t just click on the Pinterest word on the top and it takes me to the top big mistake liked it better before this last update , ','?'
'id: 93661 ',' Great ideas and cool pics...as a teacher, there are so many interesting and wonderful ideas. ','?'
'id: 93689 ',' I use it daily and never fail to get something useful out of it. ','?'
'id: 93698 ',' Please provide an update that alphabetizes our boards , ','?'
'id: 93705 ',' Such a fun app and one that I highly recommend!! ','?'
'id: 93710 ',' Love the site but crashes way too often..that has to stop , ','?'
'id: 93734 ',' I seriously have a pinning problem! ','?'
'id: 93744 ',' App closes down, if you refresh it tells you there are no pins; to fix the problem you have to delete the app and reinstall again. ','?'
'id: 93748 ',' I have no idea how I made it for so long without Pinterest!! ','?'
'id: 93757 ',' I wish there was a way to zoom. ','?'
'id: 93768 ',' Great app for when you need to kill time and be inspired! ','?'
'id: 93771 ',' Love the visual nature of the sharing rather than just posting comments. ','?'
'id: 93775 ',' why do I now have to click on the picture to like it? ','?'
'id: 93783 ',' This app crashes all the time, mostly when I  m in the middle of reading a good pin. ','?'
'id: 93784 ',' Don  t have any problems. ','?'
'id: 93793 ',' If you don  t have Pinterest, you need to get it. ','?'
'id: 93800 ',' It is easy to use but not all features available on app. ','?'
'id: 93803 ',' This app is great, easy to use, simple and just what I need for a Pinterest app! ','?'
'id: 93810 ',' There is only one issue. ','?'
'id: 93810 ',' Please give us that option back. ','?'
'id: 93850 ',' Anything and everything you need is right at your fingertips. ','?'
'id: 93850 ',' Absolutely love this app/site I recommend to EVERYONE! ','?'
'id: 93853 ',' Pinterest gives me the motivational quotes, workout plans and recipe ideas that I need to stay on track with my health and fitness goals. ','?'
'id: 93865 ',' Since the last update the app crashes less during pinning &amp; pins much faster. ','?'
'id: 93872 ',' I just wish that in the humor category that people could lighten up on the exceptionally long (actually it is deep, in that the posts are so deep, long, or tall that it slows down refreshing of the pins adjacent to it.) ','?'
'id: 93872 ',' And, how about policing the categories to make sure that they contain pins that should be in the category. ','?'
'id: 93880 ',' Great app, but can  t tag people like on my laptop. ','?'
'id: 93882 ',' With 5 kids the DIY craft ideas are great. ','?'
'id: 93884 ',' I can  t stop pinning!!!! ','?'
'id: 93894 ',' It may be a great idea in an image, but that is all! ','?'
'id: 93899 ',' I recommend this app for everyone , ','?'
'id: 93911 ',' Pinterest has provided countless hours of fun and entertainment! ','?'
'id: 93911 ',' Please address this problem! ','?'
'id: 93912 ',' The only problem I have is that it crashes quite often. ','?'
'id: 93913 ',' Love this app has everything I need , ','?'
'id: 93917 ',' There are ideas for everything and anything on here. ','?'
'id: 93920 ',' Defiantly recommend this app or site if looking for something creative! ','?'
'id: 93921 ',' I have made a few recipes from it already. ','?'
'id: 93929 ',' Unfortunately it crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 93948 ',' The only dislikes I would have is that some websites do not open and if there was a way to remove boards via phone..that would be awesome , ','?'
'id: 93957 ',' Please bring it back!! ','?'
'id: 93958 ',' I love it :) my only frustration is when I use it on my iPod and if the app crashes, I have to start browsing all over again and may lose a pin I was interested in but didn  t repin it fast enough. ','?'
'id: 93958 ',' Also, I can  t search up a pin I didn  t repin. ','?'
'id: 93958 ',' Wish that could be helped though. ','?'
'id: 93959 ',' It would be great if you could search within the topics, wish there was a way to not see the same pin every time someone repins it   it gets really annoying to see the same exact thing over and over and over again. ','?'
'id: 93973 ',' Since App has been updated, it crashes a lot and just freezes up. ','?'
'id: 93981 ',' You just have to!! ','?'
'id: 94004 ',' So if you really need one you can  t find it. ','?'
'id: 94006 ',' I find the only thing this app is missing is the ability to see gif files. ','?'
'id: 94008 ',' The app before the updates would take forever to load or it would crash constantly. ','?'
'id: 94032 ',' I absolutely love wasting time on this app, but it crashes quite a bit which is annoying. ','?'
'id: 94033 ',' Has anyone developed a 12 step app to quit this app? ','?'
'id: 94053 ',' My only issue that keeps it from being 5 stars is the crashing. ','?'
'id: 94053 ',' It crashes to update the page. ','?'
'id: 94053 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 94059 ',' I  m addicted to Pinterest, so it  s good that it has an app so I can use it on the go. ','?'
'id: 94071 ',' It  s annoying when it crashes but other than that I love it on my ipad! ','?'
'id: 94140 ',' I love Pinterest and have no major issue however after I ran the last update I can no longer tap "Pinterest" an have the list /pins automatically scroll back to the top when at my home page. ','?'
'id: 94140 ',' \\nAnyone else have this problem? ','?'
'id: 94151 ',' Some crash problems. ','?'
'id: 94179 ',' Awesome but it needs some way to talk to other pinners , ','?'
'id: 94197 ',' Haven  t had any issues with the new update. ','?'
'id: 94218 ',' Works so well Highly recommend it!!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 94220 ',' But with the last update every time I try to load it it says my login failed. ','?'
'id: 94232 ',' Great but sometimes crashes on me. ','?'
'id: 94235 ',' The app itself is easy to use and rarely do I ever have any issues. ','?'
'id: 94240 ',' Just have an occasional problem with clicking on a pin and it shows up so low on my ipad screen I can  t choose a board or write in comments before pinning. ','?'
'id: 94242 ',' I never have any problems with this app. ','?'
'id: 94251 ',' it  s a pretty good app, but why was the ability to refresh or bring you back to the top of the feed by tapping on the pinterest sign taken away? ','?'
'id: 94256 ',' And I just wish there was a way to alphabetize them. ','?'
'id: 94256 ',' If there is a way could somebody tell me please? ','?'
'id: 94260 ',' The app is just not doing it for me, it lags and crashes ALOT. ','?'
'id: 94267 ',' Countless other bugs I can  t list all. ','?'
'id: 94268 ',' Please take a look into how to print from a pinned site. ','?'
'id: 94268 ',' I hope you can improve the printing option! ','?'
'id: 94270 ',' This app used to crash ALL THE TIME. ','?'
'id: 94270 ',' Sometimes it takes way to long for them to load and you have to force close the app. ','?'
'id: 94271 ',' And now you have to click the picture to   like   it. ','?'
'id: 94273 ',' But, it crashes all the time, in the middle of reading a pin AND I have to click on the picture to like it, so hard, I already click on things a million times, you made it just a tad more difficult. ','?'
'id: 94274 ',' :) The only criticism I have is after a while on, it crashes, kicking you out. ','?'
'id: 94275 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 94278 ',' Says login failed. ','?'
'id: 94279 ',' My only complaint is that the app gets overloaded quite frequently and crashes. ','?'
'id: 94279 ',' What ever Im looking at when it crashes is now forever lost in Pinterest land. ','?'
'id: 94283 ',' I post a pin, it looks fine for a few minutes, then when I go back into the board where the new pin is I discover that the picture is all stretched out and distorted. ','?'
'id: 94289 ',' Please bring it back! ','?'
'id: 94291 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 94293 ',' After the new update it constantly crashed. ','?'
'id: 94294 ',' The only drawback I see is that you cannot edit boards while on the app, but this does not detract from the ease of use (not to mention FUN!!) ','?'
'id: 94294 ',' In the beginning, there were a few bugs with reloading pages, but those seemed to have been worked out with the updates. ','?'
'id: 94295 ',' \\nNever had any problems before. ','?'
'id: 94297 ',' So why only 3 stars? ','?'
'id: 94297 ',' It crashes pretty often and could use some interface tweaks but most importantly the app grows in size b/c it doesn  t seem to have a cache clearing limit or function. ','?'
'id: 94300 ',' My app has not crashed or kicked me out as other users have stated. ','?'
'id: 94300 ',' One suggestion, make it possible to where we can suggest pins to those who are following us. ','?'
'id: 94303 ',' Please make an update that will limit cache size!! ','?'
'id: 94304 ',' It has become extremely annoying and  I was hoping it would have been fixed in a previous update. ','?'
'id: 94305 ',' I am addicted to this app, however, it repeatedly crashes, and I have no sound while trying to view videos. ','?'
'id: 94305 ',' I love Pinterest, but this app could definitely use some fixing. ','?'
'id: 94307 ',' I planned my entire wedding using this app...no joke! ','?'
'id: 94310 ',' Please fix this problem then I  ll give a better review. ','?'
'id: 94315 ',' Since i can  t log in, I can  t see pins, so the app is now useless! ','?'
'id: 94322 ',' Pinterest needs to get proactive about spam protection because it ruins a great idea and they need to implement serious spam protection in this app , ','?'
'id: 94324 ',' This app has been crashing a lot since the update. ','?'
'id: 94326 ',' I love Pinterest and usually the app works fine but for the past 2 days I can  t log in. ','?'
'id: 94326 ',' It tells me there  s a network problem :( please fix and I will give this app the 5 stars it deserves. ','?'
'id: 94327 ',' When you have over 1,000 pins searching for a specific one becomes tedious! ','?'
'id: 94327 ',' Please add search option!! ','?'
'id: 94328 ',' If they don  t figure out how to decrease the size of this app it  s going to have to go. ','?'
'id: 94329 ',' too many crashes and lost connections. ','?'
'id: 94332 ',' I might have a problem. ','?'
'id: 94333 ',' Love Pinterest but the app crashes ALL the time. ','?'
'id: 94335 ',' Please fix it. ','?'
'id: 94335 ',' I suggest  including functionality that would allow users to add multiple photos at once from their photo library. ','?'
'id: 94337 ',' After update my likes and pins are same amount and Pinterest at top is now Home and won  t let you touch to go back to top. ','?'
'id: 94340 ',' Yes, it crashes. ','?'
'id: 94347 ',' I just updated this app, now I can  t log on, or re register! ','?'
'id: 94349 ',' I need some of my older recipes. ','?'
'id: 94350 ',' It needs a cache limit! ','?'
'id: 94350 ',' Plus, it crashes way too often. ','?'
'id: 94352 ',' Well the past two days I  ve been using this and it automatically logs me out and then when I go to log back in it says Trouble logging in have never had this problem before and it  s really starting to get on my nerves you need to fix this , ','?'
'id: 94354 ',' I love Pinterest, but the latest update has bugs! ','?'
'id: 94356 ',' This new update is horrible its always crashing on me and is super slow. ','?'
'id: 94357 ',' There are a few glitches that should be fixed soon, but what I wish this app had is a pin memory or something so that you couldn  t pin something twice on the same board. ','?'
'id: 94360 ',' Ccbw ,  Crashes frequently. ','?'
'id: 94363 ',' Now I can  t use my boyfriend  s iPad to log on to my Pinterest even though I  m signed in on Facebook. ','?'
'id: 94369 ',' Why u people hating on this app? ','?'
'id: 94371 ',' It ruined the app, please fix ALL bugs!! ','?'
'id: 94373 ',' This new app crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 94373 ',' And when it  s not crashing, it  s logging me off and making me wait twenty minutes to log back on. ','?'
'id: 94374 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 94378 ',' There are a few bugs however, like when I go to repin something, it goes to the bottom of the screen and won  t come back up. ','?'
'id: 94378 ',' Also, sometimes it crashes randomly. ','?'
'id: 94378 ',' Please change those things. ','?'
'id: 94379 ',' kelsey LILA ,  Pintrest automatically logged me out a couple days ago randomly, and now will get an error or validation error whenever I try logging in again. ','?'
'id: 94382 ',' This app is so frustrating, it crashes every 2 minutes or so. ','?'
'id: 94382 ',' You guys need to step it up. ','?'
'id: 94383 ',' please bring back the capability to tap "Pinterest" and auto scroll to top!!!!! ','?'
'id: 94384 ',' However, they need to find a way to keep this app from continually taking up more and more space. ','?'
'id: 94390 ',' However sometimes it crashes hike I am exploring a pin. ','?'
'id: 94392 ',' I wish you could search within your own pins. ','?'
'id: 94393 ',' You need to make it so that Pinterest tells you within the app that someone commented on your pin. ','?'
'id: 94395 ',' Where is the following list? ','?'
'id: 94396 ',' And why in the world is this much data being stored on my phone? ','?'
'id: 94396 ',' Should NOT be setup like this. ','?'

'id: 94504 ',' You have to scroll all the way to the top with your finger and then refresh  by scrolling down AGAIN! ','?'
'id: 94506 ',' I  m on iPad 3 and when I try and repin something the repin square falls below the screen view and I can  t change what board it repins to. ','?'

'id: 96393 ',' I just wish that there was a way to easily move pins from board to board, I tend to pin to the wrong board and then have to: Go into the board, find the pin, re pin it to the right board, and then delete it from the wrong one! ','?'

'id: 96678 ',' We have an "older" iPad and that does make it difficult for the app to always run smoothly  it will crash after so many things have been pinned or searched. ','?'

'id: 96957 ',' The app crashes constantly, sometimes won  t repin anything I want it to, and now it won  t let me log in at all. ','?'

'id: 97477 ',' I  ve uninstalled a couple of times to test this, it would be nice if they fixed this. ','?'

'id: 98017 ',' Right now, when I try to repin something, it crashes as well , ','?'
'id: 98019 ',' However, today it started giving me a log in error and when I pin anything it crashes. ','?'
'id: 98022 ',' The only problem with this app is that it enables my Pinterest addiction and allows me to waste more time. ','?'
'id: 98030 ',' The only problem is, its easy to lose track of time when pinning:) , ','?'
'id: 98042 ',' What I  m talking about is if you create a new board and need to move pins to that new board and remove them from the old board. ','?'
'id: 98052 ',' If I didn  t need to work would be on it 24/7. ','?'
'id: 98053 ',' I love the art and the original things, the idea to pit everything together in boards is fantastic ! ','?'
'id: 98058 ',' Love the site and the app, but it crashes a lot , ','?'
'id: 98078 ',' The only thing I  ve found that you cannot do on this app as opposed to on a computer is tag people in your pins. ','?'
'id: 98085 ',' I love it and just maybe the more artsy folks out there see the appeal. ','?'
'id: 98085 ',' Problem is I can  t stop!! ','?'
'id: 98088 ',' This app does make it nice to be able to take a quick look at ideas. ','?'
'id: 98090 ',' But why does it have to take up so much memory on my phone? ','?'
'id: 98102 ',' And if you are an extreme pinned like I am, then that  s a problem. ','?'
'id: 98102 ',' But I love Pinterest and have no problems when I  m on my laptop. ','?'
'id: 98102 ',' The app is the only thing that has issues. ','?'
'id: 98106 ',' I love the app and everything, but it crashes, literally, every 5 minutes. ','?'

'id: 98197 ',' I can pin about 10 things and then it suddenly crashes. ','?'
'id: 98197 ',' Please fix this!! ','?'
'id: 98212 ',' I was given the choice of proceeding &amp; potentially exposing my device to destructive content or staying on the current page.the only reason why I gave the app 4 stars is because I don  t like the fact that once you click on a pin, you have to click on it again to view it  s content...it would be nice to see it all once you click on it! ','?'
'id: 98220 ',' One frustrating problem that needs a solution ASAP. ','?'

'id: 98251 ',' I set my limit to about 300 pins, otherwise it becomes an overwhelming amount of ideas that will be difficult to choose which to accomplish. ','?'
'id: 98274 ',' The only issue is that when you  re on for a long amount of time, it will close out randomly. ','?'
'id: 98294 ',' Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is not being able to pin from iPhone and sometimes not all the pins load ( just like on the computer/website). ','?'

'id: 98456 ',' I have used many of the recipes, and plan to use some of the Easter ideas. ','?'
'id: 98456 ',' I really enjoy nearly everything posted.....but, being a very senior citizen, a very few of the postings are a little distasteful.......but, I just "fly by" those and try to forget that they are there, regretfully understanding that those who post them have the right to do so. ','?'

'id: 98558 ',' Ill see an awesome pin, but by the time I repin it, it  s already to late because its crashed! ','?'
'id: 98559 ',' Only problem is that once I begin to explore the time flies and I realize 2 hours are gone! ','?'
'id: 98565 ',' I was a little curious about Pinterest when I first hear about it, so when a blog I read suggested to use Pinterest, I decided to try it out. ','?'

'id: 98616 ',' I love Pinterest but there is always a problem logging in. ','?'
'id: 98631 ',' I absolutely don  t know how I have made it in this far without Pinterest! ','?'

'id: 98650 ',' I don  t have the same issue on the iPhone app. ','?'
'id: 98652 ',' Someone just told me about it! ','?'
'id: 98676 ',' Also, I wish you could search within your own pins! ','?'

'id: 98723 ',' Every time I launch the app, it tells me that the login failed. ','?'
'id: 98723 ',' But the login fails the first time, everytime. ','?'
'id: 98724 ',' Please fix that!!! ','?'
'id: 98731 ',' It does what I need it to. ','?'
'id: 98740 ',' Wheelerob ,  I have try for many weeks to downloaded to mi iPhone and I haven  t been able to, why is that if it was working before the last update? ','?'

'id: 98757 ',' I just LOVE LOVE LOVE!! ','?'
'id: 98784 ',' I  m pinning and I can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 98801 ',' My only complaint is the random crashes. ','?'
'id: 98804 ',' Works for a few, then crashes. ','?'
'id: 98807 ',' Is there a place in Settings that can fix this? ','?'
'id: 98818 ',' I love pintrest but I hate when I am in the middle of reading something and it crashes. ','?'
'id: 98818 ',' On average pintrest crashes 3 5 times a day either on iPad or laptop, really frustrating, but I keep coming back because of all of the information despite the frustration : ( would love a crash fix! ','?'
'id: 98819 ',' and the designers that post their innovations. ','?'
'id: 98826 ',' App crashes randomly, frequently when I try to pin something. ','?'
'id: 98826 ',' Then you have to search again and scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll to where you were before the app crashed. ','?'
'id: 98829 ',' At night to wind down she can usually be found on pinterest. ','?'
'id: 98842 ',' I originally signed up with my Facebook account but I keep getting an error every time I try to login with the app , ','?'
'id: 98844 ',' Good app but almost everyday, it crashes. ','?'
'id: 98853 ',' App will crash unexpectedly. ','?'
'id: 98859 ',' Great app, but it crashes anytime I want to click on a pin to open up a web page .....so I just email the pin to myself and look it up later on my PC....that  s the only drawback , ','?'
'id: 98861 ',' \\n\\nConstantly crashes...especially when it goes to source of pins...this app needs work. ','?'
'id: 98862 ',' I can get inspiration to make almost anything unique just by flipping through the pictures and adding my own touches!! ','?'
'id: 98868 ',' However, as another reviewer said earlier, the app needs some work. ','?'
'id: 98887 ',' I love pinterest and this app is nicely designed in the layout but I have problems with it crashing all the time...that  s the only reason I didn  t give it 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 98889 ',' App is pretty great but it crashes a lot , ','?'
'id: 98897 ',' The app feeds my Pinterest addiction wherever and whenever I need it. ','?'
'id: 98899 ',' The interface is really user friendly but it crashes ALL the time. ','?'
'id: 98903 ',' With that being said, the iPad app needs a good bit of improving, it crashes or freezes up just about every time I use it. ','?'
'id: 98908 ',' The app crashes after about three minutes. ','?'
'id: 98908 ',' I hope this problem gets fixed in the next update. ','?'
'id: 98918 ',' I would only improve on one thing, more prices should be listed. ','?'
'id: 98927 ',' I really like Pinterest but...the responses  from customer service are rude &amp; I was told both times it was my problem that Pinterest lost my boards. ','?'
'id: 98927 ',' I  m guessing the IT customer service must be outsourced over seas. ','?'
'id: 98932 ',' This app works good although it crashes a bit too often. ','?'
'id: 98953 ',' The app crashes and closes a lot making it frustrating to browse. ','?'
'id: 98968 ',' I recommend it to anyone and everyone. ','?'
'id: 98973 ',' Hardly crashes. ','?'
'id: 99001 ',' Very upsetting when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 99011 ',' WHY are there pins of people I am not following on the "following" tab? ','?'
'id: 99011 ',' Pinterest needs to get its act together. ','?'
'id: 99017 ',' \\nNote: I do wish there were a way to let us know when we  ve pinned something before. ','?'
'id: 99031 ',' Just love it! ','?'
'id: 99037 ',' There is no way you won  t be impressed if you  re into all things visual . ','?'
'id: 99040 ',' I love the concept, but this ting crashes about every 2 5 mins. ','?'
'id: 99040 ',' Maybe they are just trying to curb my pinterest addiction,but I can handle myself! ','?'
'id: 99041 ',' I like having the app on my phone more than my home computer because I get way more use out of it. ','?'
'id: 99048 ',' \\n\\nMy cons are that I  ve had pictures I uploaded to a board disappear (and I  ve already deleted them from my computer), at times the app crashes &amp; if something is flagged as spam it won  t let you just pin the picture without a reference link. ','?'
'id: 99054 ',' So easy to find just about anything you  re interested in   who knew so many people could have such brilliant ideas?! ','?'
'id: 99059 ',' Love Pinterest but I had to only give 4 stars because there needs to be a way to eliminate offensive and/or obscene images. ','?'
'id: 99063 ',' It  s a problem. ','?'
'id: 99083 ',' I love this app, only wish I could figure out how to put different descriptions under the pins instead of what the previous pinner wrote. ','?'
'id: 99084 ',' My only complaint is that I have no idea how to find ppl outside if Facebook on the mobile app , ','?'
'id: 99087 ',' Love Pinterest, I might be addicted. ','?'
'id: 99087 ',' Sometimes app will randomly close, but nothing is lost and they seem to have made improvements to this , ','?'
'id: 99088 ',' I like that you can use the browser in the app to pin pictures but I just wish that there were more options like tabs and bookmarks so it would be easier to pin from the web on my ipad. ','?'
'id: 99091 ',' Sparks creativeness, ideas are endless and it  s absolutely amazing!!!!! ','?'
'id: 99092 ',' Love the inspiration &amp; how you can create your own places of interest! ','?'
'id: 99097 ',' Might work better on newer machines, but on my iPad,when browsing, it will start loading a page full of pins but almost always crashes (blank screen, then an exit) before it gets the page full. ','?'
'id: 99106 ',' This was a great idea! ','?'
'id: 99121 ',' I don  t really know how to work it well but still like it! ','?'

'id: 99217 ',' Only problem I have encountered is it refreshes every time u go back to pins. ','?'
'id: 99224 ',' It would be nice if everyone would put some sort of subject in the description they type before they pin it so when you search more stuff comes up. ','?'

'id: 99361 ',' Love being able to access my broads on the go, from a recipe idea to party planning I use the app to NAIL IT! ','?'
'id: 99403 ',' It would be nice if the app had the same functionality as the website as far as editing pins and rearranging boards, but it  s fine for casual browsing/pinning. ','?'
'id: 99413 ',' Please fix the CRASH issue that is obviously a persistent issue. ','?'
'id: 99417 ',' Also, what happened to being able to delete double entries? ','?'
'id: 99417 ',' I repos things twice on accident and can  t delete one! ','?'

'id: 99449 ',' Works great and I never have any problems with it! ','?'
'id: 99452 ',' Wish the app would not allow u to post duplicates. ','?'
'id: 99455 ',' As a beginning sewer I find the ideas and tutorials on Pinterest to be priceless. ','?'

'id: 99504 ',' Anytime I need a recipe or am throwing a shower I go here. ','?'
'id: 99523 ',' The only "issue" i have is that I wish there was some way to pin websites like I do on the computer rather than just re pinning things from other pinners. ','?'
'id: 99523 ',' But despite that one small thing, I just LOVE it! ','?'
'id: 99525 ',' Plus, I never have any technical problems with it. ','?'

'id: 99577 ',' Love pinterest but the app could use some improvement. ','?'
'id: 99581 ',' It  s really annoying when I  m looking at a picture and it closes and I almost never can find the picture again? ','?'
'id: 99582 ',' This is a good app but it won  t let you invite people to join from the app version and they definitely have some kinks to work out (e.g. It tells you that you  re not following someone when you really are; the activity screen doesn  t load at all) Overall, though, it is good and the pictures look crisp on the iPhone 4S version. ','?'
'id: 99600 ',' The best ideas are here! ','?'
'id: 99655 ',' Pin something you like, find it later when you need it. ','?'
'id: 99655 ',' Don  t forget to search for specific things you love. ','?'
'id: 99662 ',' This app is great very little problems , ','?'
'id: 99675 ',' I had to give it only 4 stars out of 5, because the app sometimes acts up and shuts down mid use which can be quite annoying. ','?'
'id: 99682 ',' I occasionally have an issue with the app just closing but it doesn  t happen enough for me to not use it! ','?'
'id: 99709 ',' Could use a little improvement, but it works great and never crashes. ','?'
'id: 99726 ',' It does occasionally crash but that is really not distracting. ','?'
'id: 99730 ',' Love the App but crashes every 5 minutes. ','?'
'id: 99747 ',' Only complaint is my pictures do not always save to my photo album on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 99777 ',' It  s addictive and it makes you be creative or want to be creative! ','?'
'id: 99781 ',' That being said, i m very disappointed when people post things that take u to a website that charges you money for the product. ','?'
'id: 99805 ',' I use it all the time and have never had a problem with it. ','?'
'id: 99806 ',' It would also be nice if it would auto refresh when you open it. ','?'
'id: 99855 ',' \\nIt have everything that a person always want to know!!! ','?'
'id: 99863 ',' I LOVE Pinterest, but this app crashes way too much. ','?'
'id: 99863 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 99868 ',' However, it will often just crash for no reason, and also almost all of the time crashes if I choose I view the website the pin is attached to. ','?'
'id: 99879 ',' Never fails it happens when I am looking at something fabulous. ','?'
'id: 99885 ',' Only problem I have is that it keeps crashing on me on my iPad , ','?'

'id: 99895 ',' Never realized how addicting this could be, more so than a lot of game apps available! ','?'
'id: 99906 ',' No need to be creative anymore! ','?'
'id: 99909 ',' Just love it ! ','?'
'id: 99918 ',' I spend hours browsing and pinning :) I just used Pinterest to find a recipe for dinner. ','?'
'id: 99923 ',' I do have a problem with app closing for no reason. ','?'
'id: 99926 ',' I am sure that will be fixed in the next update. ','?'
'id: 99929 ',' Once your start you can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 99934 ',' I like that I can create and personalize any category I want. ','?'
'id: 99942 ',' Even after refresh, no pins or boards available. ','?'
'id: 99949 ',' I also like that you can do a   search   for something you are looking for. ','?'
'id: 99953 ',' The things I  ve found on here and ideas are priceless! ','?'
'id: 99965 ',' I just need to stop looking at it before bed. ','?'
'id: 99998 ',' Problem primarily is in a "board", in that I can display all my pins, just not after clicking a board. ','?'
'id: 99998 ',' Take a note from the Houzz app how to navigate pictures, it is pretty smooth. ','?'
'id: 100304 ',' &amp; having an app for it just makes it all the better! ','?'

'id: 107644 ',' Pinterest has actually saved me money since I no longer need my magazine subscriptions! ','?'
'id: 107650 ',' App is good but crashes occasionally which can be frustrating , ','?'
'id: 107658 ',' If they could find a way to fix that glitch it would be a lot better. ','?'
'id: 107662 ',' But it crashes, crashes, crashes! ','?'
'id: 107662 ',' I can  t even open one of my boards! ','?'
'id: 107666 ',' It  s probably user error, but I can  t delete or move pinned items if I accidentally pin to the wrong board. ','?'
'id: 107667 ',' But the app is nearly as good, which I can  t say the same for every app. ','?'
'id: 107734 ',' Though I can not figure out how to add photos from my phone! ','?'

'id: 107823 ',' Helped me plan my whole wedding and I  ve never had to buy a cookbook. ','?'
'id: 107827 ',' Good app, but it crashes sometimes , ','?'
'id: 107830 ',' I absolutely love this app, but it crashes every single time i go on it. ','?'
'id: 107830 ',' Ridiculously annoying, especially because i can only be on it for about 8 minutes at a time until it crashes. ','?'
'id: 107830 ',' I have updated it every time an update has been available, but nothing has helped. ','?'
'id: 107843 ',' Wonderful app, works perfectly, just like desktop version. ','?'
'id: 107845 ',' Do not know what I did before Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 107862 ',' The biggest problem I have is that it just randomly shuts down. ','?'
'id: 107867 ',' Currently if you create your own pin, it doesn  t link to anything. ','?'
'id: 107869 ',' Of course there are little bugs like anything, but it  s still amazing! ','?'
'id: 107872 ',' You should be all over this better to hoard online then in your house so many things to try , ','?'

'id: 107960 ',' All you need to do is add it for nook so I can share with some of my friends!!!! ','?'
'id: 107979 ',' It  s great when it works but it has failed 3 times this week alone. ','?'
'id: 107990 ',' The ideas I get are great for crafting and clothes and hair and beauty ideas...but it is VERY frustrating when Pinterest goes POP and disappears before my eyes. ','?'
'id: 107993 ',' Also, it would be VERY convenient if the app could tell me if I have already pinned a certain thing. ','?'
'id: 107998 ',' Great app haven  t had any problems with it! ','?'
'id: 108001 ',' I  ve had this app for months and just recently started understanding how to use it. ','?'

'id: 108022 ',' I have made several of the recipes and they have been a total hit with my picky eaters! ','?'
'id: 108036 ',' Haven  t had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 108044 ',' Who needs Facebook when you can have Pintrest and all the fun of pinning! ','?'
'id: 108046 ',' The only thing I don  t like is the fact that there ar a lot of crashes and when I click on the app it takes a while to load, you also need to be able to move pins from one board to another easier. ','?'
'id: 108052 ',' I love this app, but I wish there was a better way to rearrange pins and put them on new boards. ','?'
'id: 108053 ',' Also, when you try to play a video in the app, you can  t get any sound, so you have to open it up in Safari. ','?'
'id: 108060 ',' It has everything u can imagine and how to do it!! ','?'
'id: 108063 ',' This app is amazing and always around when I need a quick creative idea! ','?'
'id: 108072 ',' I wish I had Pinterest when I was planning my wedding. ','?'

'id: 108165 ',' The app gives me access to the site when I  m out and about and need to kill time. ','?'
'id: 108174 ',' I also like that it  s available on my phone, I can cook recipes by viewing my pins on my phone. ','?'
'id: 108187 ',' Only suggestion would be to adjust the app so you can add a new pin instead of having to go to the website! ','?'
'id: 108189 ',' So much great handmade items you can  t find anywhere else! ','?'
'id: 108198 ',' Now I know how long my shirts should be and how to wear a suit like a king , ','?'

'id: 108208 ',' all pictures are very well organized, some have great tips on how to learn something, best way to describe it is a blend of you tube and Instagram. ','?'
'id: 108212 ',' But it crashes on me a lot, especially with larger pictures. ','?'
'id: 108213 ',' Only log on if you have a couple hours to spare. ','?'
'id: 108217 ',' The app is awesome and never crashes , ','?'
'id: 108219 ',' I love it however I can  t really change anything about my profile on it such as my profile picture! ','?'
'id: 108227 ',' Give me great ideas how to dress, eat healthier, exercise and decorate my home. ','?'
'id: 108228 ',' I don  t like that it crashes occasionally, though. ','?'
'id: 108232 ',' Love that I have access to Pinterest where ever I go so I can look up projects etc when I need them , ','?'
'id: 108236 ',' It defiantly needs a "back to top" button like that desktop version has, instead of having to scroll all the way to the top. ','?'
'id: 108238 ',' All my Fb friends love it too, has everything you need 5 stars. ','?'
'id: 108246 ',' App cleanly presented, doesn  t glitch out, even better now that you can open links in safari. ','?'
'id: 108247 ',' Only problem is that sometimes it will kick me out and restart the app. ','?'
'id: 108290 ',' Only frustration is the chore of rearranging pins when you decide that it IS worth adding another board after all. ','?'
'id: 108293 ',' I haven  t had very many issues with the app, occasionally it  ll say there  s an error and when you retry to pin you end up with duplicates, but most of the bugs have been fixed. ','?'
'id: 108304 ',' This app as saved me money by showing me how to use these ideas and do it myself! ','?'
'id: 108312 ',' I like that they made long pins so you can scroll down. ','?'

'id: 108322 ',' Love this app...just wish you could move pins to a different board if you made a mistake , ','?'
'id: 108336 ',' JaiRocket ,  The only problem is it seems like once you hit the bottom of the page that is it. ','?'
'id: 108339 ',' The only stinky thing is that it crashes sometimes, probably from the overload if awesomeness. ','?'
'id: 108352 ',' The only this I don  t like it after looking through Pinterest it crashes. ','?'
'id: 108353 ',' There are so many ideas I never seen before until I went on Pinterest. ','?'

'id: 108425 ',' I am planning several events that I do not wish my family to see, so these have been great but I am maxed out on those. ','?'
'id: 108437 ',' My biggest complaint however is that the app crashes often. ','?'
'id: 108449 ',' How did I ever manage before Pinterest? ','?'
'id: 108451 ',' It  s great to have access when I need it even if I  m not at home. ','?'
'id: 108457 ',' Love the ap, but it crashes almost every time i try to follow the pin back to the website. ','?'
'id: 108471 ',' Refresh tool needs a little work, though. ','?'
'id: 108473 ',' Ugh, I updated it and now when I am browsing pins it won  t stop crashing and closing. ','?'
'id: 108473 ',' \\n\\nI love Pinterest, please fix this bug. ','?'

'id: 108483 ',' My favorite app when I need some recipes, an outfit idea, or just some inspiration! ','?'
'id: 108483 ',' Only bad part is that the creators need to fix some crashes that come out of nowhere but I STILL LOVE Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 108484 ',' Occasionally crashes and restarts. ','?'
'id: 108490 ',' I run on iPhone 5 and I never had any issue with the app ever!!! ','?'
'id: 108506 ',' Those are minor issues though, when compared to how much fun it is! ','?'
'id: 108507 ',' I really like this app, but sometimes, often enough for it not to be coincidence, the app crashes on my iPad and then I lose my spot, usually losing the pin or board I was looking at in the process. ','?'
'id: 108510 ',' But the mobile app tends to crash here and there. ','?'
'id: 108511 ',' If someone likes it...you can find it! ','?'
'id: 108513 ',' You will lose hrs on this site!!! ','?'
'id: 108526 ',' Awesome for many things, except that the app tends to crash often and doesn  t always save pictures to your phone when you request it to. ','?'
'id: 108528 ',' Could love it if it would not crash all the time on my iPad 1, I  m addicted. ','?'
'id: 108534 ',' Only downside is missing time from being on it. ','?'
'id: 108536 ',' Interesting and relaxing\\nDo wish there was a better way to filter inappropriate content. ','?'
'id: 108536 ',' Sorta works but not totally\\nAlso need a way to better move groups of pins from one folder to another in your own boards , ','?'

'id: 110413 ',' Cambw ,  I cannot add pins from my ipad camera roll and can  t find any info on the app to help. ','?'
'id: 110414 ',' I absolutely love the Pinterest idea, as far as rating the app, it crashes often and there  s ALWAYS and API error or message that says "sorry problem on our end" it gotten so frustrating!!! ','?'
'id: 110416 ',' Well I wouldn  t give this any stars but apple apparently thinks that it should not be an option. ','?'
'id: 110416 ',' anyhow I downloaded this app for my iPad and it is constantly crashing, and I think it  s funny considering that I have the exact same app on my phone (thats a droid), and guess what it never crashes! ','?'
'id: 110420 ',' I can be on it less than a minute before it crashes again! ','?'
'id: 110421 ',' I can  t stand when I go to change my search field a little bit and it starts automatically searching again after I enter one letter without me telling it to. ','?'
'id: 110421 ',' Please fix this bug ASAP!!!! ','?'
'id: 110421 ',' I also cannot stand how it crashes all the time. ','?'
'id: 110421 ',' At least 50 times a day it crashes. ','?'
'id: 110427 ',' You would make my day if you added that button! ','?'
'id: 110428 ',' I love the app but it repeatedly crashes every few minutes. ','?'
'id: 110428 ',' And the last update didn  t do anything to fix it. ','?'
'id: 110429 ',' Total fail, Pinterest  iPhone app so much stronger and easier to navigate  why aren  t gestures the same? ','?'
'id: 110432 ',' Love this app but it crashes every time I use it. ','?'
'id: 110433 ',' Site is crashing every 2 minutes. ','?'
'id: 110434 ',' The iPad app crashes EVERY time I use it. ','?'

'id: 110441 ',' :/ I  m always about to pin something fabulous and then BAM gone cuz the app crashed. ','?'
'id: 110442 ',' But WHY can you not pin things to it from an outside source like you can on the iPad? ','?'
'id: 110449 ',' But please, please, please fix the crashing! ','?'
'id: 110453 ',' The app always crashes on me while I  m in the middle of reading something so then when I try to go back it won  t be there and ill have to search for it because new stuff comes on in the explore section it was in. ','?'
'id: 110454 ',' However, using this app is difficult and frustrating as it crashes every 5 10 minutes. ','?'
'id: 110454 ',' When it crashes, you lose where you were, so it  s impossible to locate where and how you got to a particular board or image. ','?'
'id: 110454 ',' This is the largest flaw as it quickly causes productivity to decrease, being unable to track your steps or relocate what you had been looking at to discover more images similiar or related boards. ','?'
'id: 110454 ',' Another error occurs where when browsing, pictures just stop loading and I receive an error when attempting to view the source of the image so I am unable to see where it originated from. ','?'
'id: 110455 ',' The app improvements have been great...now they need to take it a step farther and make it easy to move your pins between your boards. ','?'
'id: 110457 ',' It  s easy to use, but it seriously crashes way to much and the update doesn  t stop it from happening. ','?'
'id: 110460 ',' That being said, there are legitimate and significant problems in terms of crashing. ','?'
'id: 110468 ',' \\nI find something i absolutely love, I go to pin (and or click on pin) it crashes (iphone even w new updated ios) \\nFix it! ','?'
'id: 110469 ',' Website doesn  t require registration to look. ','?'
'id: 110470 ',' The only problem is that you can  t save a picture to your camera roll. ','?'
'id: 110471 ',' I love the pintrest app but it CRASHES ALLLL THE TIME!!! ','?'
'id: 110473 ',' I love the app but every few minutes the app crashes needs to be fixed , ','?'
'id: 110474 ',' There are so many wonderful ideas and recipes. ','?'
'id: 110477 ',' But it crashes. ','?'
'id: 110478 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 110483 ',' \\n\\nAlso it constantly tells me there are no pins available on my boards. ','?'
'id: 110483 ',' \\n\\nI don  t have these problems if I open pinterest in safari or use the app on my phone. ','?'
'id: 110484 ',' I  ve read about it crashing but has never done that to me so far. ','?'
'id: 110485 ',' Please fix that. ','?'
'id: 110486 ',' Great app, it does crash sometimes though. ','?'
'id: 110487 ',' Constantly crashes, and you must relogin every time it does. ','?'
'id: 110488 ',' Crashes more now than it did before the update...please fix the problem!! ','?'
'id: 110489 ',' I love being able to check this wherever I am but it crashes way too often , ','?'
'id: 110490 ',' I use it all the time, but it really frustrates me that it CRASHES every 5 minutes on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 110490 ',' I dont own a computer so please fix this bug!! ','?'
'id: 110491 ',' This is a game that crashes and I  m done with it....better on the computer tho. ','?'
'id: 110492 ',' Never crashes , ','?'
'id: 110494 ',' It crashes a lot, but it is running a crazy lot of pictures so thats kind of understandable. ','?'
'id: 110496 ',' App crashes way too much. ','?'
'id: 110497 ',' Still crashes after updates. ','?'
'id: 110500 ',' I like the app but it always crashes. ','?'
'id: 110501 ',' The constant crashes every few minutes and reported from so many people is puzzling. ','?'
'id: 110501 ',' Perhaps you need to outsource a technician than can find and fix the problem because your current employees apparently aren  t getting this extremely aggravating bug fixed. ','?'
'id: 110502 ',' Before I updated this it never crashed! ','?'
'id: 110505 ',' It consistently crashes multiple times. ','?'
'id: 110505 ',' I can barely be on there for 10 minutes before it crashes. ','?'
'id: 110508 ',' Used to work just fine but for the last few months it crashes and then will not let you back in! ','?'
'id: 110511 ',' I would use it so much more but honestly it  s become so aggravating. ','?'
'id: 110511 ',' Please fix this problem!!!!! ','?'
'id: 110514 ',' I have actually done a few things from here but when I find something I really like it crashes on me and I can never find it again. ','?'
'id: 110520 ',' ,  I love this app, but it crashes every 5 minutes, if not more often. ','?'
'id: 110525 ',' Thanks for a great site if this problem could be fixed. ','?'
'id: 110527 ',' I love Pinterest but am so tired of it crashing on my iPad that I find myself going to it less and less. ','?'
'id: 110529 ',' The app is constantly crashing and giving little screen gems like "pin not found", "updated never". ','?'
'id: 110529 ',' You can tell Facebook, Pinterest, &amp; Instagram are all owned by the same conglomerate, because the designers fail every time to make a half decent working app. ','?'
'id: 110531 ',' The only downside that really doesn  t bother me is that the mobile app crashes a lot but really no big deal :) , ','?'
'id: 110534 ',' There are times "no pins are available". ','?'
'id: 110534 ',' So, why not? ','?'
'id: 110534 ',' I should probably update, right? ','?'
'id: 110534 ',' Please fix it! ','?'
'id: 110536 ',' Hopefully you will see this and please get back with me. ','?'
'id: 110536 ',' Please respond My rating will change when I can get it on my iPad or get response back .thank you Still trying to get logged in your app is an absolute joke you say you fixed the bugs it  s ridiculous it  s no better than it was before. ','?'
'id: 110536 ',' I have been trying to get help with this app for months I don  t know what you people do but obviously somebody has dropped the ball nobody gets back with you it continues to go on and on and on. ','?'
'id: 110536 ',' It keeps telling me that my email is invalid that  s pretty funny because I know more about my email address then you obviously do you need to get it together. ','?'
'id: 110536 ',' Just reset password still the app does not work. ','?'
'id: 110538 ',' But how do I open stuff in Safari? ','?'
'id: 110539 ',' I would suggest only 1 column to look at pins. ','?'
'id: 110543 ',' Only problem I can say is that when I  m on my iPad it does close on me and I have to restart and start over from the beginning... , ','?'
'id: 110549 ',' Consistently crashes. ','?'
'id: 110550 ',' I can  t pin while browsing on iPhones browser so what  s the point am I missing something? ','?'
'id: 110559 ',' I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 110565 ',' I was hoping that this current update would fix the fact that I cannot share to Facebook and that every time I open the app on my iPad it says login failed. ','?'
'id: 110566 ',' Update it and it still crashes after awhile. ','?'
'id: 110568 ',' Minor stupid error but really annoying I had to delete the app if it happens again I  m canceling my account how stupid. ','?'
'id: 110571 ',' And surprise the app crashed within 10 minutes. ','?'
'id: 110573 ',' I love using Pintrest to look at other people  s pins, but making my own boards and deciding who to follow has too many bugs. ','?'
'id: 110576 ',' There is, however, one glaring problem. ','?'
'id: 110576 ',' Why is that necessary? ','?'
'id: 110578 ',' Now instead of having notebooks full of ideas everything is right at our fingertips ready to use when you have time available , ','?'
'id: 110583 ',' There are so many amazing and helpful ideas! ','?'
'id: 110601 ',' It is keeping me up at night because I can  t stop!! ','?'
'id: 110603 ',' Pinterest is awesome i recommend it. ','?'
'id: 110605 ',' There are so many awesome ideas for anything you can think of and so many things you would never had thought of in a million years! ','?'

'id: 110640 ',' Using ipad 4 and have no problems. ','?'
'id: 110649 ',' IT CRASHES A LOTTTT!!!!! ','?'
'id: 110659 ',' I LOVE the app, but it crashes EXTREMELY to much for an app as popular as this. ','?'
'id: 110679 ',' After this most recent update I can  t view categories on my ipad. ','?'
'id: 110680 ',' \\nPros:\\nVery fun\\nVariety/appeals to many interests \\nLarge member base\\nSmartphone/tablet usable\\nLoads pretty fast\\n\\nCons:\\nPin blocks, while well intended can be annoying &amp; in my opinion border on censorship in some cases\\nStability has been an issue, particularly on mobile devices, 3G esp. ','?'
'id: 110680 ',' \\nLimited in user communication (I.e.: can  t message people or really contact them much)\\nSettings can  t be adjusted on mobile version; have to do it manually on safari\\nEasy to pin duplicate photos without warning\\n\\nHope this helps! ','?'
'id: 110688 ',' Still, if I  m on for awhile, it crashes and when I go back on the app I have to find my place again. ','?'
'id: 110695 ',' Other than the completely random moments it crashes, it is a pretty good app , ','?'
'id: 110718 ',' I  m obsessed and can  t stop. ','?'
'id: 110721 ',' I highly recommend this app! ','?'
'id: 110730 ',' I just love it, it  s got everything from recipes, crafts, quotes, fashion, diet &amp; exercise, decor ideas! ','?'
'id: 110732 ',' The only bad thing is it crashes right when you find the perfect pin. ','?'
'id: 110756 ',' Great app and service but wish you could swipe through pins like iOS pictures or google images. ','?'
'id: 110761 ',' I have not had any issues with this app other than it keeps me awake at night b/c I  m addicted to pintrest! ','?'
'id: 110763 ',' If you don  t have one, you need one! ','?'
'id: 110773 ',' What do I think? ','?'
'id: 110774 ',' Genius developers created a most incredible site for acquiring and sharing information! ','?'
'id: 110777 ',' Unfortunatly this app crashes alot. ','?'
'id: 110782 ',' Can have access to ideas and recipes anytime I need them! ','?'
'id: 110783 ',' So many wonderful ideas and sharing is easy. ','?'
'id: 110793 ',' Best site ever created!! ','?'
'id: 110837 ',' So inspirational BUT I will being busily browsing &amp; pinning away when it crashes. ','?'
'id: 110837 ',' Please, please fix this problem. ','?'
'id: 110837 ',' (Although, when the app crashes, I call it my time out. ','?'
'id: 110842 ',' If I had to download these pics I would totally forget a out them it some folder , ','?'
'id: 110846 ',' Very fun app that everyone needs to have! ','?'
'id: 110874 ',' I tried using Pinterest on a regular laptop but found it difficult b/c of compatibility issues. ','?'
'id: 110877 ',' I don  t have any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 110890 ',' Rarely crashes anymore. ','?'
'id: 110923 ',' What did we do with all our spare time before pinterst? ','?'
'id: 110930 ',' Pinning new things is difficult from APP...needs better integration. ','?'
'id: 110930 ',' \\n\\nBuggy...crashes often, or items fail to pin...sometimes boards ate not available...not great if I  m trying to access a pinned recipe! ','?'
'id: 110936 ',' My one and only beef with the app is that to   like   or   repin   tiles you have to open them up. ','?'
'id: 110942 ',' I want to be able to explore when I am bored and can use the bigger screen than my phone. ','?'
'id: 110955 ',' I have an iPhone 4 and I don  t seem to have any problems with the app closing out on me. ','?'
'id: 110971 ',' Never had a problem and more interesting than Facebook :) , ','?'
'id: 110983 ',' The only thing that keeps it from five stars is not being able to suggest pins to friends. ','?'
'id: 110992 ',' But it crashes (just simply closes automatically) on my iPad and iPhone WAY too frequently. ','?'
'id: 110993 ',' I can  t stop looking! ','?'
'id: 110994 ',' The only thing I could suggest is that the app make it possible to pin from an original source through this app as I do when online. ','?'
'id: 110999 ',' It  s amazing what you can find all in one place! ','?'
'id: 111005 ',' I can  t give 5 stars because every time I  m in the middle of browsing it will close on me. ','?'
'id: 111005 ',' Everyone I talk to who uses it has the same problem! ','?'
'id: 111005 ',' \\nCome on Pinterest....this app is too nice to crash this often. ','?'
'id: 111041 ',' Every time I try to upload a picture on my Pinterest app, it gives me an error and crashes. ','?'
'id: 111045 ',' Easy to use, everything is available. ','?'
'id: 111046 ',' But it crashes to much , ','?'
'id: 111047 ',' But does need a bit of tweeking &amp; additions. ','?'
'id: 111052 ',' It  s very user friendly, and I highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 111057 ',' I didn  t believe it when ppl would tell me they were hooked on Pintrest. ','?'
'id: 111058 ',' I have already done so many projects and made so many recipes I found here, and I can  t wait to do more! ','?'
'id: 111076 ',' However, it  s terribly unstable and crashes all the time (at least once per visit). ','?'
'id: 111084 ',' I planned most of my husbands 70 birthday with Pinterest! ','?'
'id: 111120 ',' I liked it a lot more when it had all the boards and categories and stuff. ','?'
'id: 111137 ',' It gets me through classes that I can  t stand and also helps me when I need a mental break. ','?'
'id: 111140 ',' But, I really hate that when you touch a pin to see it bigger, you have to scroll down just to get the back button. ','?'
'id: 111146 ',' I LOVE Pinterest but the app constantly crashes on my iPad &amp; the "save to camera roll" function never works on my iPhone. ','?'
'id: 111165 ',' The best app I could have on my phone bedsides music. ','?'
'id: 111167 ',' i had the app on my iPhone 4 and never had a problem with it. ','?'

'id: 111195 ',' Sherrypie1973 ,  Ok so I just joined Pintrest and three hours have gone by. ','?'
'id: 111198 ',' Everyone should use it! ','?'
'id: 111201 ',' My husband &amp; I just bought a 100 yr old house that needs a lot of love &amp; updating. ','?'
'id: 111204 ',' (maybe these functions already exist and I just don  t know about it?) ','?'
'id: 111220 ',' It would be better if there was some way to organize the pins within the board though! ','?'
'id: 111225 ',' The only feature I  d like to see added is an "ignore account" feature for pinners who repin on multiple boards , ','?'
'id: 111229 ',' Please, please get the app working properly. ','?'
'id: 111231 ',' You can create boards and pin anything you have an interest in. ','?'
'id: 111233 ',' I love how you can organize all the boards. ','?'
'id: 111233 ',' I wish you could make the same edits through the apps as you can on the computer. ','?'
'id: 111236 ',' They need to add uploading or creating a pin (I don  t see a way to do that) , ','?'
'id: 111273 ',' I really like the ideas available on Pinterest. ','?'
'id: 111274 ',' I can  t stop pinning ideas! ','?'
'id: 111276 ',' I love Pinterest, however I  m unhappy with the new update because I am not able to browse categories. ','?'
'id: 111276 ',' Before the update I was able to browse pins pertaining to an individual category (i.e. "woman  s fashion", "health and fitness", "humor" etc.) now the only categories available are "popular" and "everything". ','?'
'id: 111276 ',' I  d like to have the options that I had before the update, to make browsing easier and more direct. ','?'
'id: 111277 ',' I like the app but on my first gen iPad it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 111302 ',' If you need to fix something looking for a DIY project, or are hungry looking for a recipe this is the app. ','?'
'id: 111306 ',' I have made many awesome recipes that my family love!! ','?'
'id: 111309 ',' I recommend this app. ','?'
'id: 111310 ',' You can pin anything you need, especially from a computer. ','?'
'id: 111310 ',' Btw, it  s also available on a standard computer so you can use it anytime. ','?'
'id: 111315 ',' I soo love this place, great recipes and gardening ideas, i can  t stop looking , ','?'
'id: 111327 ',' I just love it!!! ','?'
'id: 111329 ',' I haven  t had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 111330 ',' It does fail sometimes which can be frustrating. ','?'
'id: 111342 ',' If Pinterest would ever go away...you could count on me being heartbroken. ','?'
'id: 111344 ',' Love the app but crashes sometimes. ','?'
'id: 111366 ',' Loads fast and I haven  t had any other problems with it! ','?'
'id: 111382 ',' Whenever I  m bored I just browse my Pinterest account for hours , ','?'
'id: 111389 ',' Why not 5 stars? ','?'
'id: 111389 ',' Because the app occasionally crashes when I  ve been looking through a lot and pins won  t load the image (gray block). ','?'
'id: 111407 ',' The app is mostly good, but crashes occasionally and has trouble punning from some sites. ','?'
'id: 111408 ',' I LOVE Pinterest but the app crashes a lot on my iPhone and iPad. ','?'
'id: 111423 ',' I love the website but the app needs an update. ','?'
'id: 111443 ',' It sometimes crashes but if they fix that then it would get 6/5 stars!! ','?'
'id: 111451 ',' Please fix this!!! ','?'
'id: 111479 ',' Would be nice to move pins around and rewrite text within pins I  ve already posted  but overall a handy &amp; worthwhile app! ','?'
'id: 111482 ',' My only issue is the number of times the app freezes and stops showing the pictures. ','?'
'id: 111484 ',' App is great but crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 111490 ',' The only problem is that you become an addicted to it!! ','?'
'id: 111496 ',' But the iPhone version could use more features. ','?'
'id: 111499 ',' Only complaint is that I wish there was a way to filter the spam/ad pins!! ','?'
'id: 111522 ',' One thing I wish this app would allow is a way to copy some of the website information on the board as since most of the websites are blogs, the links may change or may not be available. ','?'
'id: 111544 ',' My only issues are that it doesn  t seem to be updating with Facebook  i.e. doesn  t update my profile picture  and isn  t connected to Flipboard. ','?'
'id: 111544 ',' Regardless, I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 111551 ',' \\nLove how you can "pin" all of the wonderful ideas &amp; photos to your own boards. ','?'
'id: 111571 ',' Who could ever plan a wedding without pinterest now?! ','?'
'id: 111597 ',' The app works fine when searching and repining, but when creating your own board with your own pics, the only time you have the option to add photos from your device is when you are creating the new board, not afterwards. ','?'
'id: 111600 ',' Someone please tell me! ','?'
'id: 111608 ',' I  m not sure what magic voodoo others are using on their iPhones to claim that this app never crashes, but I pretty much have to assume it  ll crash at least once a day. ','?'
'id: 111618 ',' I just downloaded the app on my phone. ','?'
'id: 111624 ',' App crashes after awhile using it. ','?'
'id: 111624 ',' Loading speed is an issue sometimes. ','?'

'id: 111662 ',' I like to do specific searches and I would really like to have this feature back. ','?'
'id: 111662 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 111663 ',' Never crashes. ','?'
'id: 111672 ',' Makes everything so easy and I love how when I need to refer to a pin it brings me to my profile when I open the app. ','?'
'id: 111679 ',' It  s great, I love it, except it crashes frequently on my iPod. ','?'
'id: 111680 ',' Windows can  t touch this app...very dissapointed with windows apps and just can  t seem to get away from Apple...which is fine except for the $1000 windows laptop I now have , ','?'
'id: 111686 ',' One issue is the crashing  sometimes when I try to pin an image it freezes and crashes. ','?'
'id: 111687 ',' The app is great too, and i would give it 5 stars, except sometimes it randomly crashes and exits out of the app. ','?'
'id: 111689 ',' Stuff like, a sandbox for my kid with instructions on how to build it, raised garden beds, and so forth. ','?'
'id: 111694 ',' It never fails to inspire the creation of something new! ','?'
'id: 111702 ',' There are so many ideas for a wide range of occasions and topics! ','?'
'id: 111708 ',' I can deal with it every once in awhile but now it  s doing it almost every time I open the app it  s very annoying please fix this so I can give it 5 stars because it is amazing. ','?'

'id: 114433 ',' It would be nice to be able to privatize boards that are already created. ','?'
'id: 114433 ',' I don  t like that I can  t control who sees my pins. ','?'
'id: 114439 ',' The only things I could think to complain about is you can  t search for friends and if you are browsing a category and accidentally hit   explore   you can  t go back to the same pins. ','?'
'id: 114447 ',' But the biggest problem is that it will log me off randomly in the middle of pinning! ','?'
'id: 114448 ',' It  s unbelievable the amount of stuff you can find on here. ','?'
'id: 114454 ',' If I could suggest any enhancement it would be a quicker way to rearrange your pins and it seems to kick me off frequently. ','?'
'id: 114462 ',' This app lets me use the pins I have added in the go! ','?'
'id: 114465 ',' Then when I want to do something I just go to my boards and get the instructions!!!!!! ','?'
'id: 114472 ',' However, it crashes on occasion when I try to open the link to a pin. ','?'
'id: 114473 ',' Works great, occasionally gets slow with loading or pinning things but nothing I can  t deal with : ) , ','?'

'id: 114678 ',' I really do like Pinterest I  m am on it a ton there are two things I don  t like 1. ','?'
'id: 114678 ',' When you search you search the entire site I like that sometimes but other times I just want to search my pins I  ve already pinned since I pin so much It takes me a long time to find pins I need. ','?'
'id: 114679 ',' I really need to get a life!! ','?'
'id: 114679 ',' Love this app...need more time in the day! ','?'
'id: 114681 ',' The app crashes every now and then but overall has a nice mobile interface and an impressive (and growing) set of features. ','?'
'id: 114684 ',' The only problem I have with the app is that it will close without warning. ','?'
'id: 114689 ',' Only issue is it kicks me off randomly. ','?'
'id: 114693 ',' Would be nice to be able to scroll through comments on the busier pins! ','?'
'id: 114695 ',' It  s so neat and everything is in categories so you can pick what you want to pin. ','?'
'id: 114695 ',' I just really love this virtual pin board. ','?'
'id: 114696 ',' I love the app, but it crashes on me. ','?'
'id: 114696 ',' It wouldn  t be a problem if it crashed every once and a while, but it does it constantly. ','?'
'id: 114701 ',' And sometimes the app will crash and close and you cant find the picture you were just looking at again. ','?'
'id: 114713 ',' What bugs me about the app though is that sometimes when I click on something to see the instructions, it takes me to something that has nothing to do with what I clicked it for ! ','?'
'id: 114714 ',' Love Pinterest on my computer, but it crashes over &amp; over again on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 114716 ',' \\n\\nOne little thing though, it seems to crash a lot on my iPad :) , ','?'
'id: 114752 ',' It would be a great upgrade if they could figure out how to keep multiples of a repinned post from showing up over &amp; over on your feed. ','?'
'id: 114755 ',' Now please fix the iPad version. ','?'
'id: 114755 ',' iPad app crashes and is slow. ','?'
'id: 114762 ',' Also, it would be nice to have a more user friendly app, myself and most of my friends prefer Pintrest on PC over the app due to user friendliness. ','?'
'id: 114768 ',' I  m obsessed with the website so the app just furthers my addiction. ','?'
'id: 114783 ',' I appears to crash a lot, but I still love it. ','?'
'id: 114807 ',' I do wish there was a way to report inappropriate pictures or sites that do not pull anything up. ','?'
'id: 114817 ',' This app is such a great thing! ','?'
'id: 114829 ',' Awesome for recipes and ideas for DIY just wish they wouldn  t show the same stuff over and over and I still don  t know how to make my own pin from an Internet site, they should make that easer , ','?'

'id: 115046 ',' I love this app...you are able to find everything you need &amp; more! ','?'
'id: 115047 ',' My biggest problem with it is that it is not currently possible to limit who can see your pins/ find your boards. ','?'
'id: 115047 ',' I would give more stars if there was a way to a)limit who can see your pins and b) invite specific people to be able to see your boards. ','?'

'id: 115058 ',' Great to have it easily available on my phone. ','?'
'id: 115061 ',' Love, but It would be great if we could have subcategories for our boards!!! ','?'

'id: 117424 ',' Everything you can think of is here. ','?'
'id: 117426 ',' Please get this fixed; it  s getting to the point where I don  t want to use the app because of it. ','?'
'id: 117428 ',' I love the layout of the app and how to interact with it. ','?'
'id: 117428 ',' However, my iPad app is freezing within 2 min or less or just crashing in general. ','?'
'id: 117430 ',' Would be five stars but sick of it closing randomly and when you find something you want to pin, and no info is available when you click on the pic. ','?'
'id: 117440 ',' It has more ideas than you could ever use. ','?'
'id: 117449 ',' I may quite possibly be addicted to this app! ','?'
'id: 117452 ',' I love this app and its great but it crashes ALOT and you can  t find the place you were before it shut down. ','?'
'id: 117452 ',' Also, with the last update it took away all the categories so now you can only choose Popular or Everything. ','?'
'id: 117457 ',' Really great app, never crashes on me , ','?'
'id: 117465 ',' I  ve never had glitches or any other problem with the app   I highly recommend it! ','?'
'id: 117466 ',' I saw pictures and thought "Oh god, just another app like Instagram probably." ','?'
'id: 117466 ',' Not only can I find recipes, but also exercises, and how to make really cool crafts. ','?'
'id: 117468 ',' My only problem is every once in a while this ap will close, I  m not sure what causes this but I do get frustrated when this happens. ','?'
'id: 117483 ',' Highly recommend it. ','?'
'id: 117490 ',' It needs to be fixed. ','?'
'id: 117500 ',' \\nWish you could pin from the Internet on the mobile app. ','?'
'id: 117502 ',' Never have a problem with it shutting down on me anymore. ','?'
'id: 117521 ',' What happened to the explore page? ','?'
'id: 117522 ',' Hey I  m never bored because I just open his app and build my fantasy closet, home, find recipes and have a few laughs! ','?'
'id: 117523 ',' Sometimes the updates create issues, but for the most part I love this app , ','?'
'id: 117544 ',' I just love pintest, it is a great past time and the idea  s I get are wonderful!!!!! ','?'
'id: 117555 ',' For something I like so much and obviously a ton of ppl do, you really need to fix that issue regarding the Apple iPhones and iPads. ','?'
'id: 117572 ',' Please put them back so I can look at all the wedding stuff!!!! ','?'

'id: 117583 ',' I haven  t had any major problems. ','?'

'id: 117604 ',' However, the navigation bar on the bottom needs to be moved or adjusted. ','?'
'id: 117605 ',' So many ideas, I don  t think I  ll have enough time to try them all. ','?'
'id: 117608 ',' Pinterest is Amazing...and that  s all you need to know. ','?'
'id: 117646 ',' But I also think there should be a place for just party ideas. ','?'
'id: 117666 ',' I don  t even need to use the computer! ','?'
'id: 117669 ',' The new update made it less appealing because you can  t access the categories anymore. ','?'
'id: 117677 ',' They added the "popular" category! ','?'
'id: 117683 ',' I have made some delicious dishes from the recipes on here. ','?'
'id: 117714 ',' It crashes every once in a while but I  m willing to overlook it since I use Pinterest many times a day! ','?'
'id: 117725 ',' Please fix this major problem!! ','?'
'id: 117730 ',' And then I figured out how to sort out who I followed and, like magic, a world of fun sewing projects, beautiful handmade hair bows for my gorgeous daughter, and oodles of recipes began to appear! ','?'
'id: 117730 ',' Now, the sewing projects are my favorite as I  m trying to eat healthier and most of the recipes are ooey, gooey chocolatey artery cloggers, but there are some really good, healthy meal ideas as well. ','?'
'id: 117730 ',' I only gave it four stars because the app crashes every 15 20 minutes and I lose what I was looking for, I didn  t like who they chose for me to follow, and I don  t like how after you  ve looked at a pin and return to "Explore" it rearranges everything. ','?'
'id: 117730 ',' So you see two pins that you  d like to check out but can only click one, you have to go on a wild search for the one that got away. ','?'
'id: 117733 ',' It never crashes! ','?'
'id: 117742 ',' Awesome app lots of fun how to  s wonderful easy recipes , ','?'
'id: 117744 ',' If you don  t have one already you must be living in a cave somewhere as a hermit. ','?'

'id: 117753 ',' What your a guy and don  t think you need this app. ','?'
'id: 117758 ',' Ebwoods82 ,  they have info on things I didn  t even know I wanted to know about! ','?'
'id: 117764 ',' I have gotten so many great decorating, do it yourself, and recipe ideas, it is unreal. ','?'
'id: 117781 ',' Please put them back! ','?'
'id: 117786 ',' I love this app, but it crashes every 10 minutes or so while browsing. ','?'
'id: 117793 ',' After I look through pins for 5 minutes, then it just crash. ','?'
'id: 117794 ',' Love this app, I  m addicted to Pinterest but it crashes All the Time , ','?'
'id: 117796 ',' But I will have to say it does sometimes crash when I want to pin something or try to save a photo it won  t actually save it. ','?'
'id: 117802 ',' Everything is good except the app crashes constantly and you lose what you were looking at. ','?'
'id: 117812 ',' It  s very easy to use and I love that I can be anywhere and just open up my Pinterest and start pinning. ','?'
'id: 117818 ',' I do wish that there was a way to fix certain things like sometimes a link to a blog from a pin is no longer available. ','?'
'id: 117818 ',' It needs to be edited. ','?'
'id: 117818 ',' We need to be able to flag that stuff better as inappropriate , ','?'
'id: 117824 ',' I have a lot already but I am planning more and this has given me so many ideas. ','?'
'id: 117825 ',' And some recipes you need some common sense to know if its practical or not. ','?'
'id: 117832 ',' I do refer to it when i need ideas for a specific topic and pinterest never fails me. ','?'
'id: 117833 ',' Only thing I had issues with at first was figuring out how to get the menu icons to pop up at the bottom of the screen and the title of the page and directional arrow to appear at the top. ','?'
'id: 117833 ',' It  d be nice to either have easier access to the different options of pages, or just throw in a pop up tip at the start up of the app when you first download it, telling you how to get the menu to pop up. ','?'
'id: 117834 ',' I love this app but it needs a scroll to top button! ','?'
'id: 117860 ',' I always find whatever I need. ','?'
'id: 117861 ',' I do have issues with the app closing in the middle of fetching pins. ','?'
'id: 117876 ',' Occasionally crashes, but I am sure they will fix it. ','?'
'id: 117879 ',' The only problem I have are the people that want to add viruses and such to the websites and pictures that are posted. ','?'
'id: 117880 ',' There are so many awesome ideas. ','?'
'id: 117884 ',' I am also having the two category problem since the update. ','?'
'id: 117884 ',' Please fix this! ','?'
'id: 117885 ',' Great to have it one my phone but I do get angry when it crashed out of no where. ','?'
'id: 117886 ',' It is constantly crashing. ','?'
'id: 117889 ',' \\nI hate that it crashes in the middle of looking at things. ','?'
'id: 117889 ',' \\nI also think that if a pin has been reported as spam, it needs to be removed instead of keeping it on the board. ','?'
'id: 117892 ',' My only complaint is I wish my boards could be alphabetized. ','?'
'id: 117895 ',' Please FIX it Soon. ','?'
'id: 117895 ',' Constantly crashes. ','?'
'id: 117896 ',' Doesn  t load as much anymore since the new update and only shows a few pins when the pins are actually available. ','?'
'id: 117904 ',' Just what I need to get my creative juices flowing! ','?'
'id: 117915 ',' I wish the app would let me create pins as I browse on my device. ','?'
'id: 117922 ',' Example I create a food board but now I want to take all the yummy bread recipes and put them into its own board. ','?'
'id: 117924 ',' Good way to organize ur  pins and keep up with recipes, home, DIY styles, etc. \\nDownsides: crashes sometimes when I  m in the middle of pinning something and then I loose it. ','?'
'id: 117925 ',' This app is now smooth as butter, loads quickly and never crashes. ','?'
'id: 117927 ',' BUT, the only reason I  m giving it 4 and not 5 stars is that ever once in a while it still crashes in the middle of pinning things. ','?'
'id: 117933 ',' Love this app but lately it does tend to crash a little too often. ','?'
'id: 117947 ',' It has fun things to do and make like s  more dip! ','?'
'id: 117951 ',' The only thing I wish you could do is change your board cover photos, but you can  t on a mobile device yet. ','?'
'id: 117952 ',' Awesome, everyone should have it :) , ','?'
'id: 117955 ',' The app is good when you find a recipe and you need to pull it up for ingredients. ','?'
'id: 117970 ',' Locks up occasionally and crashes , ','?'
'id: 117971 ',' \\nIt  s the new flip magazine \\nI have created so many new things from Pintrest and get to share them with others!!! ','?'
'id: 117974 ',' The only thing is that I can  t figure out how to pin things that aren  t already pinned (as in directly from a website) like I do on my computer. ','?'
'id: 117976 ',' I see that others complain that this site crashes on their phone. ','?'
'id: 117976 ',' I have an IPhone5 and it never ever crashes. ','?'
'id: 117977 ',' What could be better? ','?'
'id: 117977 ',' Please fix the crashing! ','?'
'id: 117977 ',' Right in the middle of browsing the app will crash. ','?'
'id: 117980 ',' Has that already been addressed or is there something in the works? ','?'
'id: 117985 ',' Use it just about every day! ','?'
'id: 117992 ',' The only thing I hate it crashes a lot especially in the middle of pinning. ','?'
'id: 117996 ',' Love it but I agree it crashes a lot. ','?'
'id: 117997 ',' I just got this app yesterday. ','?'
'id: 117997 ',' It never crashed. ','?'
'id: 117997 ',' I think I will have to be careful on the app because it is so easy to use, it may not fit in my budget! ','?'
'id: 117999 ',' Pinterest is awesome but this app crashes frequently. ','?'
'id: 118003 ',' I just hate how it seems to crash right in the middle of pinning something! ','?'
'id: 118005 ',' My only problem is how hard it is to edit your boards. ','?'
'id: 118011 ',' It crashes constantly! ','?'
'id: 118020 ',' Two areas where I feel the app could improve would be to add a favorites drop down for external links which would support viral product purchasing. ','?'
'id: 118021 ',' I can  t last more than 10 minutes on the app without it doing so. ','?'
'id: 118021 ',' Please fix this. ','?'
'id: 118021 ',' I see others have the same exact problem. ','?'
'id: 118032 ',' Wish I knew how to import pictures from other sites instead of relying on my 3 favorite pinners. ','?'
'id: 118033 ',' Great app but you should work on the crashing issues , ','?'
'id: 118036 ',' Great App, I have not had any problems with it. ','?'
'id: 118037 ',' Both have never failed on me. ','?'
'id: 118038 ',' Just love all the beautiful and wonderful ideas presented so succinctly  thanks so much , ','?'
'id: 118042 ',' Especially if i need the list of ingrediants for a food pin. ','?'
'id: 118043 ',' I recommend it to anyone with an account. ','?'
'id: 118044 ',' The best most addicting web site for everything you were ever looking to know , ','?'
'id: 118059 ',' For me pinterest has never crashed either. ','?'
'id: 118067 ',' Missing a few features from the desktop app...it  s annoying that I can  t tag someone in a pin, so I have to Like something, then go to the desktop app and reshare it. ','?'
'id: 118068 ',' I was reluctant to download but my friend insisted and now I can  t stop pinning! ','?'
'id: 118103 ',' Sometimes it crashes, but most of the time it works really well. ','?'
'id: 118107 ',' This app never crashes and always works at its best! ','?'
'id: 118107 ',' You know how to use it very quickly and very fast to use. ','?'
'id: 118112 ',' You can edit, delete pins, move  from one board to another, is fast &amp; efficient too. ','?'
'id: 118112 ',' You can even create new boards! ','?'
'id: 118112 ',' I don  t think there is possibly anything they can add further except making it available across more platforms! ','?'
'id: 118122 ',' Pinterest is great but the app crashes and 50 repins approximately. ','?'
'id: 118122 ',' It would be nice if you could take a board and make it private without having to re create it and move everything over. ','?'
'id: 118127 ',' The reason for only giving four stars is because it will randomly crash sometimes (usually if you  ve been using it for a while). ','?'
'id: 118130 ',' But it crashes SO much lately, I can barely click on any of the links! ','?'
'id: 118132 ',' The newest update made it a messy terrible app. ','?'
'id: 118132 ',' Fix this update, please , ','?'
'id: 118135 ',' Makes it easy for me to refer back to something I like when in out and about and need supplies but forgot my list. ','?'
'id: 118142 ',' What happened? ','?'
'id: 118142 ',' This was a decent app (didn  t crash much, easy to use) before the latest update. ','?'
'id: 118151 ',' When something actually does load and I tap on it, the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 118159 ',' Only problem is with the latest update the people repin counter on the notifications counts an extra person. ','?'
'id: 118164 ',' This app is amazing, yes I agree I hate the crashing, but it  s convenient when multitasking and looking for ideas of what to wear, what to cook, how to organize , cleaning schedules, and so much more!!! ','?'
'id: 118173 ',' I love Pinterest, but it crashes on my iPad constantly. ','?'
'id: 118173 ',' It never crashes on my phone, though. ','?'
'id: 118184 ',' Why are there no more categories? ','?'
'id: 118187 ',' I love it, I just wish that when you followed a link to a site and wanted to pin something else from that site you could so so within the app rather than using a work around. ','?'
'id: 118195 ',' \\nI love the app but it crashes all the time since the last update. ','?'
'id: 118196 ',' The only thing that needs to be fixed is that sometimes the app will close on its own and causes me to loose my pins. ','?'
'id: 118202 ',' This app crashes all the freaking time. ','?'
'id: 118203 ',' This app is super entertaining; I  m honestly on it everday at night when I can  t sleep! ','?'
'id: 118208 ',' I haven  t had any issues with this app since I  ve installed it. ','?'
'id: 118231 ',' I love Pintrest, but sometimes the app crashes and it  s really annoying when it happens. ','?'
'id: 118234 ',' I have one problem though, this last update totally messed up my app, it only shows two categories, I can  t see any of the undid y  all ones like decor and wedding or fashion all that jazz, it  s really irritating how do I see those again?! ','?'
'id: 118235 ',' But on my iPhone there are only 2 categories? ','?'
'id: 118254 ',' Good but crashes a lot , ','?'
'id: 118257 ',' It has crashed a few times, but it  s a rare occurrence. ','?'
'id: 118263 ',' I love Pinterest and im on it almost everyday but I kinda wish it would tell me what ive already repinned and like besides that great , ','?'
'id: 118272 ',' For the past couple of weeks, every time I open the app it says I have a login error and need to try again. ','?'
'id: 118273 ',' Haven  t had any issues with it except when I use it on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 118273 ',' When using my iPad it crashes like crazy. ','?'
'id: 118274 ',' My only problem is that some of my own pins didn  t upload right from my phone. ','?'
'id: 118274 ',' I had pictures I wanted to pin and it made the pin but the picture is not there, even when I tried to remake it. ','?'
'id: 118274 ',' If this was fixed, I can  t think of anyway to  make this app better. ','?'
'id: 118279 ',' I just don  t like how easily it crashes. ','?'
'id: 118286 ',' The only thing I need is more time for these great ideas! ','?'
'id: 118288 ',' I love it and have made lots of things from others great ideas! ','?'
'id: 118291 ',' Only one suggestion: if there was a "recipe button" that I could use to keep my phone or tablet from going to sleep while cooking a recipe or doing a craft I saw it would be the best app ever made. ','?'
'id: 118296 ',' Sometimes I can  t even log in because the connection also times out A LOT! ','?'
'id: 118297 ',' Wish it worked better on my iPad, often crashes when opening pins. ','?'
'id: 118305 ',' Who needs magazines. ','?'
'id: 118305 ',' I just pin it , ','?'
'id: 118306 ',' Contrary to many of the reviews I  ve read, my app VERY rarely crashes. ','?'
'id: 118311 ',' I love Pinterest and have had no problems using this app. ','?'
'id: 118323 ',' Very entertaining and never crashes! ','?'
'id: 118327 ',' Love this app but the constant crashing needs to be addressed! ','?'
'id: 118329 ',' But the app constantly crashes on my iPad. ','?'
'id: 118334 ',' Wish they would tell you when you have pinned something twice though. ','?'
'id: 118343 ',' I love pint rust but they really need to fix the  system crashes. ','?'
'id: 118347 ',' Once you pin you can  t stop! ','?'
'id: 118349 ',' Now you have to open pic to pin. ','?'
'id: 118349 ',' Please give that option back. ','?'
'id: 118362 ',' Please fix the crashes!!!! ','?'
'id: 118371 ',' A previous update caused it to not work at all, but it appears to be 98% functional now. ','?'
'id: 118377 ',' I recommend checking it out! ','?'
'id: 118386 ',' What happened? ','?'
'id: 118405 ',' Sometimes it crashes which can get very annoying! ','?'
'id: 118406 ',' I just wish you could delete people off of your "news feed" like thing. ','?'
'id: 118406 ',' Don  t need to be seeing stupid designer clothes from people I am not even following. ','?'
'id: 118419 ',' Does sometimes crash but i love all the new innovative ideas. ','?'
'id: 118422 ',' Just wish they made an iPad app that had the same functionality as a regular computer gets. ','?'
'id: 118422 ',' \\n\\nI also wish you could flip to the next picture versus backing out. ','?'
'id: 118425 ',' I don  t know if its just me but this glitch needs to be fixed , ','?'
'id: 118426 ',' The app tends to crash everytime I want to look at something but other than that, it is a good app. ','?'
'id: 118430 ',' So I  m stuck somewhere in the app , it says no news items are currently available , I can  t even get out of it . ','?'
'id: 118430 ',' I try pushing the Pinterest sign but it doesn  t work . ','?'
'id: 118431 ',' I haven  t had problems with it crashing so far, but it slows down at "peak hours" when everyone else is on. ','?'
'id: 118432 ',' I love Pinterest but this app has been crashing a lot lately and it  s getting frustrating. ','?'
'id: 118432 ',' If this issue could be fixed it would be a 5 star app without question. ','?'
'id: 118434 ',' I  m addicted to Pinterest, but I hate when the app crashes. ','?'
'id: 118445 ',' Keeps crashing on my iPhone 4S and every time I create a new board a spam board appears in its space and it won  t let me load my own photos for boards , ','?'
'id: 118446 ',' The app crashes if you use it A LOT (which I do) and while slightly irritating, it usually doesn  t do it when I am in the middle of something, it is usually when I am mindlessly scrolling and should be sleeping, haha! ','?'
'id: 118448 ',' I love this app but it freezes and crashes all the time and I just close it and give up. ','?'
'id: 118450 ',' As addictive as Pinterest can be, it  s incredibly frustrating to have it crash and/or lock. ','?'
'id: 118452 ',' I recommend it!! ','?'
'id: 118455 ',' I give 4 stars only because it occasionally has small issues with the app and has been allowing more and more risqu? ','?'
'id: 118467 ',' I wish there was a book called "Pinterest for Dummies",  not sure why there are so many pins that are repeats, why its so hard to figure out how to find something. ','?'

'id: 119796 ',' I  ve spent hours reorganizing boards and moving pins from large boards to more specialized board because there is no easy way to move pins on the app or the site. ','?'
'id: 119802 ',' I think it crashed once or twice but it  s not annoying at all. ','?'
'id: 119832 ',' \\nIt goes something like that, right? ','?'
'id: 119836 ',' You can  t pin to it from your phone, though. ','?'
'id: 119837 ',' The problems I run into include: \\nIt crashes after about 30 min fairly regularly \\nThere are a lot of pictures that take you to spam sites and each time a picture is pinned, it doesn  t keep track of those sites\\nOther then that it  s a fun app! ','?'

'id: 119878 ',' However it crashes regularly. ','?'
'id: 119880 ',' It is highly addictive I love having access right on my phone if I  m really bored and need ideas for inspiration. ','?'
