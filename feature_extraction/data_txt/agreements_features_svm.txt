1	Addictive I love to pin the things that interest me and watch as other people enjoy my pinning.	7
1	Addictive...love it!	1
1	Additionally, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to organize among a couple different dimensions for easy retrieval at a later date.	3
-1	After a few easy levels, I am again practicing my aim.	1
-1	After I did the update it will not open.	1
-1	After the last update, it crashes every time I open the manual upload.	2
-1	After the latest upgrades, there were issues and now it crashes and I cannot access anything.	3
-1	After this latest update I can't even get into my account on either my iPhone or iPad it says incorrect password!!!	3
-1	After you beat level 22-2 it freezes and doesn't give you the points for the level	1
1	Again, working like the desktop version would be better here.	3
-1	Agree with recent reviewers - this update completely ruined this excellent app for the iPhone on IOS7	3
-1	Agree with recent reviewers - this update completely ruined this excellent app for the iPhone on IOS7.	3
-1	ALL 1,300 photos were deleted.	2
1	all in one spot From hair styles, to do-it-yourself ideas, fashion ideas to quotes...	7
1	All info available is just what is needed!	5
-1	All it needs is multiple accounts!	2
1	All my files and especially my photos are being synced FAST to my laptop.	2
1	All of my reminders, notes and receipts in one place.	3
-1	All other worlds crash except the first one	1
1	All pictures are locked and frozen.	2
1	All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want.	3
-1	All the notebooks are there but they are all empty.	3
1	All the tools you need to plan your vacation are right at your finger tips with this great app!	5
-1	All these updates, and I still can't rename things?	2
1	All you need for decorating pictures is in this app	6
1	Allow users to force a sync!	2
1	Already addicted to the easy interface and concise, appropriate info.	5
1	Also an improvement in the media player would also help.	2
-1	Also in Evernote hello there is no categorizing.	3
-1	Also its more cumbersome to swipe through images since it's only responsive on the top half of the screen instead of the whole screen.	2
1	Also lets me post my crafty side and get more feedback.	7
1	Also like web integration.	3
-1	Also lost the ability to export into pages for editing.	2
1	Also makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer since I never seem to move them.	2
1	Also makes preparing a menu easier!	7
-1	Also please stop auto loading of images in feed section.	7
-1	Also pops up for you to rate it at every log in so save yourself the annoyance and rate it right away.	7
-1	Also slows down a ton when I open another board besides my own.	7
-1	Also the Daily Rewards Power Up/Slot Machine no longer loads anymore.	1
-1	Also the play, re, fw controls you get after double clicking the home button no longer work with this app.	2
1	Also very good for finding a good hotel.	5
-1	Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders?	2
0	Also would be nice to rename files.	2
0	Also would love to have an individual resort map of all the resorts available to view.	5
0	Also, an ability to highlight/edit PDF's would be rad.	2
0	Also, can you please add the option to copy and move files?	2
-1	Also, I haven't found an undo option on the app version so when I accidentally delete content, I have to do it over.	3
1	Also, I love the new interface.	3
0	Also, I think it would be really fun if you incorporate a doodling function in Evernote.	3
1	Also, I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline.	3
-1	also, it'll be cool to add videos!	3
-1	Also, navigating thru app is now cumbersome and not as simple and elegant as before.	5
-1	Also, still not able to rename files -- unbelievable!!	2
-1	Also, the button for it is right under the pause button, which made me use it even more, I am now out of uses simply because they put it in a lousy location.	1
-1	Also, the delete function is confusing and should have some sort of dialog box informing you that you are about to delete a photo on your ipad, not just in dropbox interface, and ask you to confirm that you want to do this.	2
-1	Also, there is no logic behind the new tag section.	3
-1	Also, using the same view in landscape mode is really ugly and wastes screen real estate.	3
0	Also, when reviewing I can rate different categories on the iPhone instead of just an overall rating on the iPad.	5
-1	Although it does take quite a while to load it seems.	2
-1	Although this is just a personal opinion, I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing.	3
1	Always find fun things to do and good food.	5
1	Always full of things that are interesting to me without chasing me or interrupting my enjoyment with endless advertising.	7
1	Always works as promised and delivers useful info and travel tips!	5
1	Amazing I love that I can even upload my own personal photos and have them as a pin!	7
1	Amazing	5
1	Amazing ;-) Amazing app ... the best way to stay in touch with ur frnd.. sharw images ... videos .	8
1	Amazing app it is very healfull and very freindly to use	5
-1	Amazing Game Now 4 Free!!	1
-1	An average app It's good.. but when it comes to "updating", it's pathetic!!	8
0	An Evernote system of tags and saved searches would enable us to keep all photos/video in one place and still sort them when needed.	2
1	An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel.	5
1	An extra I really like are the street maps and metro guides.	5
1	And for collaborating with others by using shared files and folders.	2
1	And great that it has desktop integration for a computer.	3
1	And help me with ideas for parties and all kinds of gathering and celebrations.	7
1	And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities.	3
-1	And I have to load it because its the ONLY way I can use it on my phones browser which isn't the mobile site anymore.	7
0	And just a user friendlier way to change settings and customize/add pictures to your boards.	7
-1	And now it says trouble reaching evernote server.	3
-1	And now we also can't see our notes on the map filtered by tag.	3
-1	And now, it takes 15 minutes to login when I open the app.	1
1	And photos of where you are considering to stay.	5
0	And please, add the ability to tag photos and video.	2
-1	And subcategories.	2
-1	And that would NOT be version 5.2.1.	3
-1	And the new power of the red bird, directional targeting, kinda goes against the appeal of the original game -- you fire a bird and can't change it's direction.	1
1	And the voice recognition is great!	2
-1	And then I couldn't open all my notes.	3
-1	And then I logged into my account through the website and no notes are there either...	3
-1	And they even have an app that loads to your phone and no data is required (as long as you load the city before you use it)	5
-1	And when you email or cut&paste into something else - it is a nightmare.	3
1	And you can even try to find the hidden items too.	1
-1	Another update!	1
-1	Any way the other one was better and you took away everyone's favorite levels!also same thing as #5	1
-1	Anyhow, I miss Catch and some others.	3
-1	Anyone can c my profile pic Its dangerous.	8
-1	App crash Keeps crashing when you click on to the attach option	8
-1	App should be much much better, can't go 1/2 of what you can online, can't post pictures,can't see my profile or past reviews, can't even give detailed ratings, needs to be much improved	5
-1	app used to work wonderful except recent update.. unable to open most of our PDF files .. DROPBOX help!!!	2
1	April I really luv diz app...great effects on ur pic....	6
-1	As a result, failures are frustrating because the controls fight my attempts at precision, and successes are unsatisfying because it feels like I just caught a lucky break.	1
-1	As a result, synching between devices is not always reliable right now - just a watch-out.	3
-1	As soon as I get to the level selection the app crashes.	1
-1	As soon as i updated to version 2.1.	2
-1	As soon as this was updated it will no longer give me accurate search results!	7
-1	Asking for unnecessary permissions Also I do not want the app to run at startup!	7
-1	At first when I got this it was cool, but then when I changed my mined about having my camera uploads in my Dropbox it says that I don't have any photos in my library when I clearly have photos in my library....please fix!!	2
-1	At the moment, you can't copy/paste text, many users (myself included) have reported a typing bug where the cursor jumps when you try to type, rendering the note taking part useless.	3
1	At times even faster than ordinary sms.	8
-1	At times frustrating to try to navigate to check rates.	5
-1	Avoided updating the latest version becos during the last update, all the info which were not synchronized and backed up were swiped off!!	3

-1	Become very unstable and unsupported to my device Now a days it gives a big problem for my HTC desire V device  whenever someone or group chat text message me in marathi language or used in more smily in that  message that time whatsapp is directly closed and suddenly come back to the home screen and never open it....	8
-1	Been trying to download a 1gb file for over 2 days now.	2

1	Brilliant It's a great  way to keep in contact with people you know :)	8
-1	Brilliant app but crashes on iPad and iPhone.	3
-1	Btw the solution to that 1 (after I tried reinstalling and rebooting) is to log in using user name instead of email (or vice versa.	3
1	Btw, I use the skitch add-on for editing,reformatting, *bold* print, etc.	3
-1	Buggy, slow and insecure	3
-1	But after recent updates I have issues uploading things.	2
-1	But after the newest update that removed the white dotted path that shows where your bird is aimed at and the strength you are using on the sling shot, its very difficult to play and not that fun.	1
-1	But for me, the heart of the app is the near me now section.	5
-1	But for some reason dropbox has not allowed favorited downloads the ability to resume  and instead restarts the download from the beginning every time it fails.	2
-1	But I cant even access to my account because the app crashes in iphone size every time i open it.	2
-1	but i don't understand why we can't add a website even though it's an option.	3
-1	But I have noticed that you can't share folders, only a single file, which is pretty ridiculous because then I could just email that single file to someone, but when you have a whole bunch of pictures that you want to send, you can't send the whole folder of pictures.	2
-1	But I have to rate it 4 stars because you made the menu worse looking.	1
-1	But I mostly use Dropbox for music and it gets kind of annoying that the music doesn't go in a playlist like in the music app.	2
0	But I wish saved items could be viewed offline!	5
-1	But in game ADs are really annoying.	1
-1	But in my mobile, after downloading the app, it works six months after that again it shows date failure and it will not work... Again I have to download...	8
-1	But iOS 5 is required to use it.	2
1	But it does allow me to take a pic, and record voice, so that helps.	3
-1	But it has becum too slow since d last update..!!	8
1	But it has gud to connect wid ur frnds.	8
-1	But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time.	2
1	But it works on all computers, including Mac.	3
-1	But now it crashes if you select "Created" or "Title" for the viewing mode.	3
-1	But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync.	3
-1	But sometimes the customised jpeg file customised is not recognised by the library/album.	6
-1	But the design of this app is terrible.	3
-1	But the developers keep shoving the new shock bird in your face to keep buying whenever you're stuck.	1
-1	But the fact that I cannot add recent photos from my album!?!?!!?	3
-1	But the latest level just takes this game to a new level of low.	1
-1	But the performance is no smooth at all.	5
-1	But this new level is along the lines of Bad Piggies.	1
-1	But very discouraged when I go to do a something that I get advertisements for a ton of other stuff.	7
-1	But why does location need to be enabled?	2
-1	But wish it didn't steal all of your data.	8
-1	BUT WISH THERE WAS A PASSCODE TO OPEN THE APP!	3
-1	But with this new upgrade requiring iOS 7 (which I don't have), and many apps supporting other cloud storage providers, I find I may have to switch to Box, SugarSync, Mega, Mozy, or any of the other cloud storage sites who aren't forcing me to upgrade to iOS 7.	2
-1	But, one thing that's still missing is bulk downloads.	2
-1	But, overall an excellent app still.	5
-1	But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews.	5
-1	By far an overall awesome app but it needs an update	1
-1	By the way if you are complaining because of the logo for Roviow on the Angry Birds App then stop its just saying who it's made by( just a picture!	1

0	Can we get push notifications for other things being shared, besides just folders.	2

-1	Can't play because it crashes constantly!	1
-1	Can't read cached PDF	2

1	Honestly, it took me some time to get used to using this application - web clipping, photo notes, sharing, etc., but now I find this app to be the "deal killer" - the one thing that MUST be on every device - The note scanning is so powerful it can read my scribbles (take notes in a meeting, take pics in evernote, throw them out!	3

-1	however there is still a problem which is that when you try using the "open in" option in other iPad applications, and ask to open in Dropbox, the filed just opened shows up in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated... meaning that file is not found in the Dropbox folders if you access the folders in a different device/computer, etc...	2

-1	I can't believe Rovio went to all this trouble to turn a perfectly fun and addicting game into a game that should just be thrown in the trash!!	1
-1	I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote, which was the ability to style lines as either a section, subsection, paragraph or blockquote.	3

-1	I catch myself just jotting notes on a sticky pad and leaving them on my desk...	3
-1	I choose a level and it keeps crashing!	1
-1	I click on the icon, my enter password shows up and either it's stuck on that and I can't even enter a password, or I enter it and nothing happens.	2

1	I do all of my bookings with TripAdvisor through the app or through the Internet and it still works very well!	5

0	I do wish I could change my board cover and have more categories like on the website.	7
-1	I do wish that when sharing the notes, they didn't look like garble when I use colors and formatting.	3
-1	I don't have a good sense of what actually kills the pigs, versus just wounding them, and any results I get don't seem at all repeatable from one attempt to the next.	1
-1	I don't just mean the iPhone or iPad versions, but rather the entire concept.	3
-1	I don't need to see a leader board.	1
-1	I don't really know how to created the file like a word document or something.	2
-1	I download a 700 mb file and open it in a app I really don't need to have it in two places on my iPad.	2

1	I downloaded the city app while I was travelling and was very happy to find that the maps worked even without using data.	5
1	I enjoy using trip advisor and would probably post more reviews if I could see a list and access my own reviews from the app.	5
1	I enjoy your creativity to find ever more and different puzzles for me.	1
1	I especially like the web clipper and then emailing right from Evernote	3
-1	I even purchased the Pro version.	2
-1	I find I must logon again each and every time I open the app on my iPad2 running iOS7.	3
1	I find it very handy to be able to copy from penultimate straight to Evernote!	3
-1	I find the interface to be awkward, but the biggest fault w this app is its poor syncing across devices.	3
-1	I find the new levels to be more frustrating and I don't get that "just one more before bed" hooked feeling I get from the other Angry Birds levels and spinoffs.	1
1	I find this app one that I use whether I am at home looking for a restaurant that I have not tried or to make recommendations for friends planning on visiting the area.	5
-1	I found this app pretty helpful overall for finding hotels and reading reviews, however the search feature was a bit limited and didn't allow me to filter by brand name easily.	5
-1	I generally love Dropbox, but since I upgraded to iOS 7 I can no longer view html files properly (I am referring to files saved on my Dropbox as .html).	2
-1	I get a big black screen every time I try to click on the hotels pictures.	5
-1	I get a pop up about push notifications and if I push ok it pops back up again making it completely inoperable.	2
-1	I get the logo screen and then the app crashes completely.	2
1	I go and then post my thoughts.	5
1	I got this app free thanks to FeaturePoints!	1
-1	I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me.	2
-1	I guess they are forcing us to pay for premium, find alternative, fellows!	3
-1	I had higher expectations for this new version.	5
-1	I had to upload all the pictures to a named folder, then I had to use the Internet browser to login to Dropbox and then send the link to the folder from there.	2
-1	I hate giving this 3 stars, but know its just for the app interface, not Evernote itself, which I love.	3
-1	I hate how hard iris to put different notes into different notebooks, though!	3
-1	I hate it so much I don't want to give itBull crap.stupid	1

-1	I have a factory refurbished older iPad and it cannot run IOS 7.	2

-1	I have all the iPod ones but deleted rio cause I didn't like it.	1
-1	I have also had issues refreshing feed at times...but otherwise great app.	7
1	I have been using Dropbox for years now and I have never been more happy when it comes to sharing files with myself (between all my devices) and with friends.	2
1	I have been using the app for sharing files while I travel but it know longer works.	2
-1	I have camera upload on and when I opened it, it started reuploading over 200 photos even though they were already there.	2
-1	I have had this game for a long while and never had problems, once I updated my phone to iOS 7, and re-downloaded angry birds on an I-phone 4 I have not even been able to play the game but rather fight glitches, not full screen and will not respond.	1
-1	I have had this program for over a year now.	3
-1	I have inadvertently deleted entire notes because of the new layout, which is slow and barely functional.	3
1	I have it on all my devices to note ideas down, clip web articles and can search through everything.	3
1	I have it uploading my photos, which it does consistently well and syncing docs I need.	2
